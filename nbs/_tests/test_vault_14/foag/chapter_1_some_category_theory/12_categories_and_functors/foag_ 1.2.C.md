# Double dual functor on the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor[^1]
1.2.C. EXERCISE. Let $(\cdot)^{\vee V}:f.d\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathrm{k}} \rightarrow f \cdot d . \operatorname{Vec}_{\mathrm{k}}$ be the double dual functor from the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over $k$ to itself. Show that (.) $^{V V}$ is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor on $f . d . \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathrm{k}^{*}}$ (Without the finitedimensionality hypothesis, we only get a natural transformation of functors from id to $\left.(\cdot)^{\vee \vee} .\right)$

Let $\mathscr{V}$ be the category whose objects are the k-vector spaces $k^{n}$ for each $n \geq 0$ (there is one vector space for each $n$ ), and whose morphisms are linear transformations. The objects of $\mathscr{V}$ can be thought of as vector spaces with bases, and the morphisms as matrices. There is an obvious functor $\mathscr{V} \rightarrow f . d . \operatorname{Vec}_{\mathrm{k}}$, as each $\mathrm{k}^{n}$ is a finite-dimensional vector space.
