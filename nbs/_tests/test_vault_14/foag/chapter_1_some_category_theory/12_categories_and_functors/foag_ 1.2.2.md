# Category of sets[^1]
1.2.2. Example. The prototypical example to keep in mind is the category of sets, denoted $\mathrm{Sets}$. The objects are sets, and the morphisms are maps of sets. (Because Russell's paradox shows that there is no set of all sets, we did not say earlier that there is a set of all objects. But as stated in $\S 0.3$, we are deliberately omitting all set-theoretic issues.)
