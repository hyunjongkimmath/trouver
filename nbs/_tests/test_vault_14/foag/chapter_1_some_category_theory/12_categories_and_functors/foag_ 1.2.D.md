# Topic[^1]
1.2.D. EXERCISE. Show that $\mathscr{V} \rightarrowf.d.Vec_{\mathrm{k}}$ gives an equivalence of categories, by describing an "inverse" functor. (Recall that we are being cavalier about settheoretic assumptions, see Caution 0.3.1, so feel free to simultaneously choose bases for each vector space in $f \cdot d . V e c_{k} .$ To make this precise, you will need to use GÃ¶del-Bernays set theory or else replace f.d. Vec $_{\mathrm{k}}$ with a very similar small category, but we won't worry about this.)
