# Category of open subsets of a topological space[^1]
1.2.9. Example: the category of subsets of a set, and the category of open subsets of a topological space. If $X$ is a set, then the subsets form a partially ordered set, where the order is given by inclusion. Informally, if $\mathrm{U} \subset \mathrm{V}$, then we have exactly one morphism $\mathrm{U} \rightarrow \mathrm{V}$ in the category (and otherwise none). Similarly, if $\mathrm{X}$ is a topological space, then the open sets form a partially ordered set, where the order is given by inclusion.
