# Forgetful functor[^1]
1.2.12. Example: a forgetful functor. Consider the functor from the category of vector spaces (over a field k) $\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathrm{k}}$ to Sets, that associates to each vector space its underlying set. The functor sends a linear transformation to its underlying map of sets. This is an example of a **forgetful functor**, where some additional structure is forgotten. Another example of a forgetful functor is $\mathrm{Mod}_{\mathrm{A}} \rightarrow A b$ from A-modules to abelian groups, remembering only the abelian group structure of the A-module.
