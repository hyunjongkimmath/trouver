# Subcategory of a category[^1]
1.2.10. Definition. A **subcategory** $\mathscr{A}$ of a category $\mathscr{B}$ has as its objects some of the objects of $\mathscr{B}$, and some of the morphisms, such that the morphisms of $\mathscr{A}$ include the identity morphisms of the objects of $\mathscr{A}$, and are closed under composition. (For example, $(1.2 .8 .1)$ is in an obvious way a subcategory of $(1.2 .8 .2)$. Also, we have an obvious "inclusion functor" $i: \mathscr{A} \rightarrow \mathscr{B}$. )
