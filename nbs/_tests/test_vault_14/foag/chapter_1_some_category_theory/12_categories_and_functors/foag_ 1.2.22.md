# A covariant functor is an equivalence of categories if it is fully faithful and essentially surjective[^1]
1.2.22. $\star \star$ Aside for experts. Your argument for Exercise 1.2 D will show that (modulo set-theoretic issues) this definition of equivalence of categories is the same as another one commonly given: a covariant functor $\mathrm{F}: \mathscr{A} \rightarrow \mathscr{B}$ is an equivalence of categories if it is fully faithful and every object of $\mathscr{B}$ is isomorphic to an object of the form $F(A)$ for some $A \in \mathscr{A}$ (F is **essentially surjective**, a term we will not

need). Indeed, one can show that such a functor has a quasiinverse (another term we will not use later), i.e., a functor $G: \mathscr{B} \rightarrow \mathscr{A}$ (necessarily also an equivalence and unique up to unique isomorphism) for which $G \circ F \cong i d_{\Delta}$ and $F \circ G \cong i d_{B B}$ and conversely, any functor that has a quasiinverse is an equivalence.
