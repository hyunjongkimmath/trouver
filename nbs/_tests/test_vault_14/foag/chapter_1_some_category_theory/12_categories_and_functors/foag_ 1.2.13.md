# Topological functor examples[^1]
1.2.13. Topological examples. Examples of covariant functors include the fundamental group functor $\pi_{1}$, which sends a topological space $X$ with choice of a point $x_{0} \in X$ to a group $\pi_{1}\left(X, x_{0}\right)$ (what are the objects and morphisms of the source category?), and the ith homology functor Top $\rightarrow A b$, which sends a topological space $X$ to its ith homology group $H_{i}(X, \mathbb{Z}) .$ The covariance corresponds to the fact that a (continuous) morphism of pointed topological spaces $\phi: X \rightarrow Y$ with $\phi\left(x_{0}\right)=y_{0}$ induces a map of fundamental groups $\pi_{1}\left(X, x_{0}\right) \rightarrow \pi_{1}\left(Y, y_{0}\right)$, and similarly for homology groups.
