# The Burau representations at $d$-th roots of unity[^1]
The Burau  representations **$\rho_n(d)$** at  $d$-th roots of unity If  $\mathfrak{a}\subset R$ is  an ideal  stable under  the involution $f\mapsto \overline{f}$, and  $A=R/\mathfrak{a}$ is the quotient ring, then on  the $A$-module  $A^n$ we get  a corresponding  Hermitian form **$h_A$**,  and  a corresponding  representation  **$\rho _n(A):  B_{n+1}\rightarrow GL_n(A)$**,  which maps  $B_{n+1}$  into $U(h_A)(B)$  where  $B$ is  the quotient ring $S/\mathfrak {a}\cap S$.

We can take ${\mathfrak a}$ to be the principal ideal in $R$ generated by **$\Phi _d(q)$**  where  $\Phi _d(q)$  denotes  the $d$-th  cyclotomic polynomial  in $q$.   Then the  quotient **$R_d=R/{\mathfrak  a}$**  is an integral  domain  (the  ring  of  integers in  the  $d$-th  cyclotomic extension **$E_d$**  of $\mathbb{Q}$).  The reduction modulo  the ideal $\mathfrak a$  of the  representation  $\rho _n$  yields  a representation  **$\rho _n(d)$**  of the  braid group  $B_{n+1}$.  This  is referred  to  as the **representation obtained by evaluating  the representation $\rho _n$ at (all the) primitive $d$-th roots of unity**. 

Note  that there  is no  preferred embedding  of the  cyclotomic field field $E_d=\mathbb{Q}[q]/(\Phi _d(q))$ into the field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers, since there is no preferred choice of a primitive $d$-th root of unity in $\mathbb{C}$.  We  will therefore not consider $E_d$ as  a sub-field of $\mathbb{C}$ but  as being  naturally embedded  in the  product $\prod  _{\mu }\mathbb{C}$, where the  product is over  all the primitive  $d$-th roots $\mu$ of unity (the map into the product  is obtained by evaluating $q$ at {\it all} the primitive $d$-th roots of unity).


Denote  by  **$\Gamma  _n(d)$**  the  image of  the  representation  $\rho _n(d)$. The image goes into the group $U(h)(O_K)$ where **$K=K_d$** is the (totally  real)  sub-field of  $E_d$  invariant  under the  involution $f\mapsto \overline{f}$: $K=\mathbb{Q}(2cos(\frac{2\pi}{d}))$ and **$O_K$** is the ring of  integers in  $K$.  We will  consider arithmetic  subgroups of (i.e. subgroups which have finite  index in) $U(h)(O_K)$ (we refer to subsection \ref{arithmeticgroups}  for a  discussion on why  these are arithmetic groups in the sense of \cite{Gr-Sch}).  

Consider the  group $\Gamma  _n(d)\subset U(h)(O_K)$. The  ambient Lie group  in which $U(h)(O_K)$  is naturally  a lattice  (see the  end of subsection \ref{arithmeticgroups})  is the product  group **$G_{\infty}= \prod _{v \mid  \infty} U(h)(K_v)$** where the product  runs through all the archimedean completions $K_v$ of  $K$.  Since $K$ is totally real, $K_v$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ for  each $v$.  The form $h$, however, may be  different for  different  real  embeddings of  $K$.   when $h$  is non-degenerate, there exist non-negative integers **$r_v$** and **$s_v$** with $r_v+s_v=n$ such  that the unitary group $U(h)(K_v)$  is isomorphic to $U(r_v,s_v)$ as an algebraic group  over $\mathbb{R}$ (when $h$ is degenerate, the unitary group $U(h)(K_v)$ has a unipotent radical and the quotient by the unipotent radical is of the form $U(r_v,s_v)$ with $r_v+s_v\leq n-1$). In  the course of the  proof of arithmeticity  of monodromy, we never need  to use  the ambient group  $G_{\infty}$; we  work directly with  the arithmetic group  $G(O_K)$ and  the monodromy  group $\Gamma \subset G(O_K)$.   For these reasons,  we do not specify  the integers $r_v$, $s_v$ and the ambient Lie group $G_{\infty}$.
