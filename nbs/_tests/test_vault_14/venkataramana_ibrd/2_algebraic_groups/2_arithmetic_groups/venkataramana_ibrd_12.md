We then  have $R_{K/\mathbb{Q}}G(\Z)\simeq G(O_K)$ where the  symbol $\simeq $
means that there is equality up  to subgroups of finite index (the two
groups  are {\it  commensurable}).  Moreover,  ${\mathcal G}(\mathbb{R})\simeq
\prod  _{v\mid  \infty}G(K_v)$, where  the  product  is  over all  the
inequivalent archimedean completions of $K$  (see 2.1.2, on pp. 50 and
51 of  \cite{Pl-Ra}). Thus, $G(O_K)$ is  a lattice in  the ambient Lie
group $\prod  G(K_v)$ where the  product is over all  the inequivalent
non-archimedean completions  $K_v$ of $K$.  We recall  that any number
field has $r_1$ completions $K_v$  which are isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ and up
to complex  conjugation, $r_2$ completions $K_v$  which are isomorphic
to $\mathbb{C}$ such  that $r_1+2r_2$ is the degree of  the extension $K$ over
$\mathbb{Q}$. \\

We will have  occasion to deal with images  of arithmetic groups under
morphisms     of     $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic     groups     (see     subsection
\ref{prooffullbraid}).   In  particular,  we  will use  the  following
result.   Let $f: {\mathcal  G} \rightarrow  {\mathcal G'}$  be a  morphism of
algebraic groups defined over $\mathbb{Q}$.  This induces a homomorphism, also
denoted **$f$**, from ${\mathcal  G}(\mathbb{Q})$ into ${\mathcal G'}(\mathbb{Q})$.  It is
elementary  that if $\Gamma  \subset {\mathcal  G}(\Z)$ is  a suitable
subgroup (a  suitable ``congruence  subgroup'') of finite  index, then
$f(\Gamma )$ lies in ${\mathcal G'}(\Z)$. For a proof of the following
lemma, see Corollary (10.14) of \cite{Ra2}.
