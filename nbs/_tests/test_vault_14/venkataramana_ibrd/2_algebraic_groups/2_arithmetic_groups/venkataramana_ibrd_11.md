# Arithmetic subgroup of a linaer algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$[^1]
 \label{arithmeticgroups} 

Let  **${\mathcal G}\subset GL_N$**  be a  linear algebraic  group defined
over $\mathbb{Q}$.  A subgroup **$\Gamma \subset {\mathcal G}(\Z)$** is said to be
an **arithmetic subgroup of**  ${\mathcal G}(\mathbb{Q})$ if $\Gamma$ has
finite  index in the  intersection ${\mathcal  G}(\Z)={\mathcal G}\cap GL_N(\Z)$  (see  \cite{Ra2},  Chapter  X,  def  (10.12),  p.   165  or
\cite{Pl-Ra}, Chapter 4,  (4.1), p.  171).  By a  theorem of Borel and
Harish-Chandra $\Gamma$ is a lattice (a discrete subgroup with finite
covolume) in the group ${\mathcal G}(\mathbb{R})$ of real points of ${\mathcal G}$  provided the  identity component  ${\mathcal G}^0$  of  the group
${\mathcal  G}$  does  not  have non-trivial  homomorphisms  into  the
multiplicative  group  ${\mathbb  G}_m$   defined  over  $\mathbb{Q}$  (for  a
reference,  see  \cite{Pl-Ra} Theorem  4.13,  p  213).  It is  also  a
consequence of the result  of Borel and Harish-Chandra that ${\mathcal
G}(\Z)$ is a  co-compact lattice if and only  if $\mathbb{Q}$-rank (${\mathcal G})=0$ (see subsection \ref{rank} for the notion of $\mathbb{Q}$-rank).  \\

Let **$O_K$** denote the ring of integers in $K$; The group **$G(O_K)$** is by definition, the intersection $GL_n(O_K)\cap  G$.  A  subgroup $\Gamma \subset G(K)$  is said  to be **arithmetic**  if the  intersection $\Gamma \cap G(O_K)$  has finite index  in $\Gamma $ and  in $G(O_K)$.  This definition appears to be different from the one given in the preceding
paragraph.  But, these two  definitions are equivalent.  This is shown
by replacing  $G$ by  the Weil restriction  of scalars  ${\mathcal G}=
R_{K/\mathbb{Q}}G$ (for  a reference, see \cite{Pl-Ra}, 2.1.2,  page 49).  The
theory of Weil restriction of  scalars says that there exists a linear
algebraic group  ${\mathcal G}$  defined over $\mathbb{Q}$  (and unique  up to
isomorphism)  with   the  following  property:   for  any  commutative
$\mathbb{Q}$-algebra $A$, the group  ${\mathcal G}(A)$ is naturally isomorphic
to  $G(K\otimes _{\mathbb{Q}}  A)$,  the group  of $K\otimes  _{\mathbb{Q}}A$-rational
points of the $K$-algebraic group $G$.
