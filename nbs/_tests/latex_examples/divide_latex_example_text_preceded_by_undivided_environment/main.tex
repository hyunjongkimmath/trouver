\section{Introduction}

Blahblahblah, this document has some lists.
The `divide_latex_text` should not create a separate part for the below `enumerate`
environment; after all, it seems better to include the list in the same file/note
as the text that provides context for the list.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Rings
  \item Fields
\end{enumerate}

And here is another list, perhaps a grocery list:

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \item apples
  \item bananas
  \item milk
\end{enumerate}

Lalalala
