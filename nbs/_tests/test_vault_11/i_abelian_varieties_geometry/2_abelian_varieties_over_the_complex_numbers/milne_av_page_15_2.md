# Topic[^1]

A Riemann form on $E$ on $X$ defines a homomorphism **$\lambda_{E}: X \rightarrow X^{\vee}$** as follows: let $H$ be the associated Hermitian form, and let $\lambda_{E}$ be the map defined by
$$ v \mapsto H(v, \cdot): V \rightarrow V^{*} $$
Then $\lambda_{E}$ is an isogeny, and we call such a map $\lambda_{E}$ a polarization. The degree of the polarization is the order of the kernel. The polarization is said to be principal if it is of degree $1 .$
