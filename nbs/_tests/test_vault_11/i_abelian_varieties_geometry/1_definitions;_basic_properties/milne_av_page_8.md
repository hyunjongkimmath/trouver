Let $V$ be a group variety over $k$. For a point $a$ of $V$ with coordinates in $k$, we define **$t_{a}: V \rightarrow V$** (right translation by $a$ ) to be the composite
$$ \begin{array}{lll} V & \rightarrow V \times V & \stackrel{m}{\rightarrow} \quad V \\ x & \mapsto(x, a) & \mapsto \quad x a \end{array} $$
Thus, on points $t_{a}$ is $x \mapsto x a$. It is an isomorphism $V \rightarrow V$ with inverse $t_{\text {inv }(a)}$.
A group variety is automatically nonsingular: it suffices to prove this after $k$ has been replaced by its algebraic closure (AG, Chapter 11 ); as does any variety, it contains a nonsingular dense open subvariety $U(\mathrm{AG}, 5.18)$, and the translates of $U$ cover $V$.

By definition, only one irreducible component of a variety can pass through a nonsingular point of the variety (AG5.16). Thus a connected group variety is irreducible.

A connected group variety is geometrically connected, i.e., remains connected when we extend scalars to the algebraic closure. To see this, we have to show that $k$ is algebraically closed in $k(V)$ (AG $11.7)$. Let $U$ be any open affine neighbourhood of $e$, and let $R=$ $\Gamma\left(U, \mathcal{O}_{V}\right) .$ Then $R$ is a $k$-algebra with field of fractions $k(V)$, and $e$ is a homomorphism $R \rightarrow k .$ If $k$ were not algebraically closed in $k(V)$, then there would be a field $k^{\prime} \supset k$ $k^{\prime} \neq k$, contained in $R .$ But for such a field, there is no homomorphism $k^{\prime} \rightarrow k$, which contradicts the existence of $e: R \rightarrow k$

A complete connected group variety is called an abelian variety. As we shall see, they are projective, and (fortunately) commutative. Their group laws will be written additively. Thus $t_{a}$ is now denoted **$x \mapsto x+a$** and $e$ is usually denoted **$0 .$**
