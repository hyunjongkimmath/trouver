COROLLARY 1.4. The group law on an abelian variety is commutative.
ProoF. Commutative groups are distinguished among all groups by the fact that the map taking an element to its inverse is a homomorphism. Since the negative map, $a \mapsto-a$, $A \rightarrow A$, takes the zero element to itself, the preceding corollary shows that it is a homomorphism.
