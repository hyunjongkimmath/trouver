It is defined as $\operatorname{Hom}_R(R,M)$",reference_name_Definition 17,"Let $M$ be an $R$-module. We define the dual module $M^\vee$ as $\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,R)$. In other words, $M^\vee$ is the set of all $R$-module homomorphisms $M \to R$. Note that $M^\vee$ has a natural $R$-module structure given by $$(f+g)(m) = f(m) + g(m), \quad (cf)(m) = c f(m).$$

Let $q$ be a prime power. There is a unique field, up to isomorphism, with $q$ elements. We denote this field as $\mathbb{F}_q$ and call it the ""finite field of $q$ elements"".

Recall that we had defined the extended upper half plane $\mathbb{H}^*$. The modular curves $X(N)$, $X_1(N)$, and $X_0(N)$ are respectively the quotients of $\mathbb{H}^*$ by $\Gamma(N)$, $\Gamma_1(N)$, and $\Gamma_0(N)$."
