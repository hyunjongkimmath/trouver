\begin{definition}
\label{def: generalized disc}
Let $f \colon X \to S$ be a morphism of schemes of finite type. 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\upshape{(\alph*)}]
    \item Let the \textit{singular locus} $\mathrm{Sing}(f)$ be the reduced closed subscheme of $X$ whose support consists of all points where $f$ fails to be smooth.\footnote{Note that this definition is different from the one given in \cite[Tag~0C3H]{stacks-project}.}
    \item  If $f$ is in addition proper and flat, we say that the scheme-theoretic image of $\mathrm{Sing}(f)$ is the (generalized) discriminant locus of $f$, and denote it by $\mathrm{Disc}(f)$. 
    \item In the above situation, we say that $\mathrm{Disc}(f)$ is \textit{mild} if it has codimension at least $1$ in $S$ and there exists a dense open subscheme $V \subseteq \mathrm{Disc}(f)$ such that for every geometric point $s$ on $V$, the fiber $X_s$ has only isolated singularieties. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
