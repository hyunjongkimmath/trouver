Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. For a morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ betweem $k$-varieties, we say that $f$ has \textit{equi-dimensional} fibers if for every two points $y, y' \in Y$, $\dim X_y = \dim X_{y'}$. If $f : X \to Y$ is a smooth morphism between $k$-varieties, denote by $\mathcal{T}(X/Y)$ the relative tangent bundle, i.e., the dual of $\Omega^1_{X/Y}$. If $Y = \mathrm{Spec\,}(k)$, then we simply write $\mathcal{T} X$ for $\mathcal{T}(X/Y)$, and for a $k$-point $x \in X$, we write $\mathcal{T}_x X$ for the tangent space $T_x X$ to emphasize that it is a fiber of $\mathcal{T} X$.
