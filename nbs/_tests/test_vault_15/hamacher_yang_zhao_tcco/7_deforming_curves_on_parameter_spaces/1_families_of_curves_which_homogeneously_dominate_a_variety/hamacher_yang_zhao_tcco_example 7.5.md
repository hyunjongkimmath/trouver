# Topic[^1]
\begin{example}
Here is a prototypical example which motivates the above proposition: Consider the complete linear system $|\mathcal{O}(d)|$ of degree $d \ge 1$ hypersurfaces in a projective space $\mathbb{P}^{r + 1}$ over $k$. Let $\mathbb{G} \coloneqq \mathbb{G}(2, \mathrm{H}^0(\mathcal{O}(d)))$ be the Grassmannian of lines in the projective space $|\mathcal{O}(d)|$. It is well known that a general element $\gamma \colon \mathbb{P}^1 \to |\mathcal{O}(d)|$ in $\mathbb{G}$ is a Lefschetz pencil, and the the total space of the pencil is simply the blow up of $\mathbb{P}^{r + 1}$ along a smooth subvariety, and hence is smooth. The above proposition shows that this statement about the smoothness of the total space holds in much more generality. 
\end{example}
