Note that the properness assumption on $f$ implies that $\mathrm{Disc}(f)$ is closed in $S$. Moreover, since it is defined to be the scheme-theoretic image of a reduced scheme, it is also reduced. Its formation commutes with flat base change but not arbitrary base change: For any morphism $T \to S$, $\mathrm{Disc}(f_T)$ is always the reduced subscheme of $\mathrm{Disc}(f)_T$, so they are equal if and only if the latter is reduced.
