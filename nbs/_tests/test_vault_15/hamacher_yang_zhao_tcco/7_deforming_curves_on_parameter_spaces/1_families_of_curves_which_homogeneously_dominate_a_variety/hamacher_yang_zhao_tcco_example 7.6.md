\begin{example}
The hypothesis that $D \subseteq S$ is a proper subvariety, i.e., the morphism $f$ is generically smooth, is necessary when $\mathrm{char\,} k = p > 0$. Moret-Bailly constructed the following nice example: When $p = 3$, the surface $\mathscr{X} \subseteq \mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{A}^1$ given by the equation $y^2 z = x^3 - t z^3$ ($t$ is the coordinate on $\mathbb{A}^1$ and $x, y, z$ are homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^2$) is smooth itself, but its projection to $\mathbb{A}^1$ does not have a smooth general fiber (\cite{MB}). However, note that for Lem~\ref{lem: open in proj tangent bundle} this hypothesis is unnecessary.
\end{example}
