\begin{definition}
\label{def: homogeneously dominates}
Let $S$ and $T$ be two smooth irreducible $k$-varieties, $g \colon \mathscr{C} \to T$ be a smooth family of connected curves, and $\varphi\colon \mathscr{C} \to S$ be a morphism with equi-dimensional fibers. Let $U$ be the maximal open subvariety of $\mathscr{C}$ on which the composition $\mathcal{T}(\mathscr{C}/T) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{T} \mathscr{C} \to \varphi^*(\mathcal{T} S)$ does not vanish. 
Suppose that 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\upshape{(\alph*)}]
    \item the induced morphism $\mathscr{C} \to T \times S$ is quasi-finite, 
    \item for every $k$-point $s \in S$, $U \cap \varphi^{-1}(s)$ is dense in $\varphi^{-1}(s)$; 
    \item the morphism $U \to \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{T} S)$ has equi-dimensional fibers. 
\end{enumerate}
Then we say that the family of curves $\mathcal{C}/T$ \textit{homogeneously dominates} $S$ (via the morphism $\varphi$). If there exists an open dense subvariety $T' \subseteq T$ such that the restriction $\mathscr{C}|_{T'}$ homogeneously dominates $S$, then we say that $\mathscr{C}/T$ \textit{strongly} dominates $S$. 
\end{definition}
