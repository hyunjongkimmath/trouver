\begin{lemma}
\label{lem: countability trick}
Let $S$ be a smooth $W$-variety and let $N \subseteq S_{\bar{K}}$ be a countable union of closed proper subvarieties. Suppose that $S$ admits a flat morphism to another smooth $W$-variety $B$. Let $\widehat{B}_b$ be the formal completion of $B$ at $b$. Then for any $b \in B(k)$, the subset of points $\widetilde{b} \in \widehat{B}_b(W)$ such that $\mathrm{supp \,}(S_{\widetilde{b}, \bar{K}}) \not\subseteq N$ is analytically dense in the disk $\widehat{B}_b(W)$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $U := \widehat{B}_b(W)$. By taking the union of $N$ with all its Galois conjugates, we may assume that $N$ is defined over $K$. Let $N_1, N_2, \cdots$ be the irreducible components of $N$. By the flatness of $S \to B$, for each $i$ there exists a proper closed subscheme $Z_i \subseteq B$ such that every $z \in B(K)$ satisfies $\mathrm{supp \,}(S_z) \subseteq N$ only if $z \in Z_i$. Indeed, one may simply take $Z_i$ to be the complement of the image of $S - N_i$. Since each $U - Z_i$ is open dense in analytic topology, we may conclude by the Baire category theorem for complete metric spaces that $U - \cup_{i = 1}^\infty Z_i$ is analytically dense. 
\end{proof}
