\begin{lemma}
\label{lem: FAP for curves}
Let $S$ be a smooth $W$-variety and $N \subseteq S_{\bar{K}}$ be a countable union of closed proper subvarieties. Suppose that $\mathscr{C}$ is a smooth family of connected curves over a smooth $W$-variety $T$, and there is a morphism $\varphi \colon \mathscr{C} \to S$ such that the geometric generic fiber $(\mathscr{C}/T)_{\bar{K}}$ strongly dominates $S_{\bar{K}}$. Then for any $t \in T(k)$, and the set of points $\widetilde{t} \in \widehat{T}_t(W)$ such that $\varphi(\mathrm{supp \,}(C_{\widetilde{t}, \bar{K}})) \not\subseteq N$ is analytically dense. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Again we may assume that $N$ is defined over $K$ with irreducible components $N_i$. Let $M_i \subseteq \mathscr{C}_K$ be the complements of $\varphi^{-1}(S - N_i)$ and $M = \cup_{i = 1}^\infty M_i$. The assumption that $(\mathscr{C}/T)_{\bar{K}}$ strongly dominates $S_{\bar{K}}$ implies that each $M_i$ is a proper subvariety. Now we apply the above lemma with $(S \to B, N)$ replaced by $(\mathscr{C} \to T, M)$. 
\end{proof}
