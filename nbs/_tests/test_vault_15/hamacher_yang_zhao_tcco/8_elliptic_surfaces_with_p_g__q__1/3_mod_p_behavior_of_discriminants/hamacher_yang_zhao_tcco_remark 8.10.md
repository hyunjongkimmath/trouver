# Topic[^1]
\begin{remark}
The statement (b) in the above lemma is in fact equivalent to the reducedness of $\mathfrak{D}_{0, k}$. Note that the discussion of Swan conductors fundamentally uses the $p \neq 2$ assumption. This is irrelevant here because we are working with the $p \ge 5$ assumption such that Kodaira's classification of singular fibers works verbatim as in characteristic $0$. However, we refer the reader to the appendix for an example of what goes wrong in charactersitic $2$. 
\end{remark}
