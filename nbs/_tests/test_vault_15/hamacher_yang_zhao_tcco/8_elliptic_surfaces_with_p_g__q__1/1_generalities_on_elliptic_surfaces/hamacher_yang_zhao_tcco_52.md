\label{sec: generalities of ES}
In this section we recall some basic facts about elliptic surfaces and describe their moduli. Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $\neq 2, 3$. Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $k$ and $\pi \colon X \to C$ be an elliptic surface over $C$ with a zero section $\sigma \colon C \to X$ through which we also view $C$ as a curve on $X$. The \textit{fundamental line bundle} $L$ of $X/C$ is defined to be the dual of the normal bundle $N_{C/X}$, or equivalently that of $\mathbb{R}^1 \pi_* \mathcal{O}_X$. The degree of $L$ is defined to be the height of $X$, which we denote by $\mathrm{ht}(X)$. Set $V_r = \mathrm{H}^0(L^r)$. There exists a pair $(a_4, a_6) \in V_4 \times V_6 - \{ 0 \}$, which is unique up to the action of $\lambda \in k^*$ by $\lambda \cdot (a_4, a_6) = (\lambda^4 a_4, \lambda^6 a_6)$, such that $X$ is the minimal resolution of the hypersurface $X' \subseteq \mathbb{P}(L^2 \oplus L^3 \oplus \mathcal{O}_C)$ defined by the Weierstrass equation (\cite[Thm~1]{Kas})
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn: Weierstrass for elliptic surfaces}
    y^2 z = x^3 - a_4 xz^2 - a_6 z^3,
\end{equation}
where $x, y, z$ as homogenenous coordinates on $L^2, L^3, \mathcal{O}_C$ respectively. The hypersurface $X'$ has at most rational double point singularieties and is called the \textit{Weierstrass normal form} of the original surface $X$. If $X'$ is smooth, then of course $X = X'$. 


Next, we recall that Kodaira classified all the possible singular fibers in the elliptic fibration $\pi\colon X \to C$ when $k = \mathbb{C}$ in \cite{Kodaira}, and his classification is well known to hold verbatim in characteristic $\neq 2, 3$ as well. We refer the reader to \cite[\S4]{SchSh} for a summary. Set $\Delta \coloneqq 4 a_4^3 - 27 a_6^2$. Let $c \in C$ be a point and denote by $\mathrm{val}_c$ the valuation defined by a uniformizer at $c$. The only facts we shall need are the following:
