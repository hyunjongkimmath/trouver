\begin{remark}
In a recent work \cite{SB}, Shepherd-Barron proved a generic local Torelli theorem (i.e., the injectivity of the differential of the period morphism) for elliptic surfaces with $4 p_g \ge 5(q - 1)$ and $p_g \ge q + 3$. The latter condition is not satisfied in our case, so we are not able to use his results. Saito's main theorem in \cite{Saito} does apply to our case. However, Ikeda pointed out a gap in Saito's work and in fact the main results of \cite{Ikeda} contradicts Saito's theorem. We remark that Shepherd-Barron restricted to considering general elliptic surfaces (i.e., all singular fibers are nodal), whereas Ikeda's construction cannot give general elliptic surfaces. Therefore, the generic local Torelli theorem might still be true in our case.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
Let $X$ be any elliptic surface with $p_g = q = 1$ defined over a field. Let $\mathfrak{f}$ and $\mathfrak{s}$ be the elements in $\mathrm{NS}(X)$ given by a fiber and the zero section respectively. Then the quadratic lattice $\mathbb{Z}\< \mathfrak{f}, \mathfrak{s} \>$ generated by $\mathfrak{f}$ and $\mathfrak{s}$ is determined by $\< \mathfrak{f}, \mathfrak{f} \> = 0, \< \mathfrak{f}, \mathfrak{s} \> = 1$ and $\< \mathfrak{s}, \mathfrak{s} \> = -1$. It is clear that the family $\mathscr{X} \to \mathsf{M}$ is polarized by the lattice $\mathbb{Z}\< \mathfrak{f}, \mathfrak{s} \>$, whose discriminant is prime to $p$ for any $p \ge 5$. Let $\mathbb{V}_\ell$ be the $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-local system $\mathrm{PH}^2_\mathrm{{\acute{e}}t}(\mathscr{X}/ \mathsf{M}, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)$. By Thm~\ref{thm: TateStrong}, it suffices to show that for some (and hence any) geometric point $z$ on $\mathsf{M}_{\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p}$, $\mathrm{Mon}^\circ(\mathbb{V}_\ell|_{\mathsf{M}_k}, z)$ does not fix any element of $\mathrm{PH}^2_\mathrm{{\acute{e}}t}(\mathscr{X}_z, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)$ that does not come from the specialization of an element of $\mathrm{PNS}(\mathscr{X}_{\bar{\eta}(\mathsf{M})})$.\footnote{We expect that $\mathrm{PNS}(\mathscr{X}_{\bar{\eta}(\mathsf{M})})$ is zero.} 


Let $k$ denote $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p$ and write $W$ for $W(k)$. Choose an embedding $W \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$. Let $\mathbb{V}$ denote the $\mathbb{Q}$-VHS given by  $\mathrm{PH}^2(\mathscr{X}|_{\mathsf{M}_\mathbb{C}}, \mathbb{Q})$. Let $s \in \mathsf{M}_k$ by any $k$-point. By Lem.~\ref{lem: countability trick} and~\ref{lem: FAP for curves}, there exists a $W$-point $\widetilde{s}$ on $\mathsf{M}_W$ lifting $s$ such that the restriction of $\mathbb{V}$ to the fiber $\mathsf{M}_{\widetilde{s} {\otimes} \mathbb{C}}$ is non-isotrivial (or equivalently, the restriction of $\mathscr{X}$ to $\mathsf{M}_{\widetilde{s} {\otimes} \mathbb{C}}$ satisfies ($\heartsuit$)) and $\mathsf{M}_{\widetilde{s} {\otimes} \mathbb{C}}$ does not lie in the Noether-Lefshetz loci of $\mathsf{M}_\mathbb{C}$. 

We now restrict our attention to $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{L}) \coloneqq (\mathscr{C}, \mathscr{L})_{\widetilde{s}}$ over $W$. Apply construction~\ref{constr: curves dominating moduli of ES} to $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{L})$ with $S= \mathrm{Spec\,}(W)$ and let $T, \varphi, \overline{\varphi}, \mathbb{A}(\mathcal{V}_4 \oplus \mathcal{V}_6)^*$ be as in (\ref{eqn: dominate moduli of ES}). Again write $\mathscr{A}$ for the $W$-scheme $\mathbb{A}(\mathcal{V}_4 \oplus \mathcal{V}_6)$ and let $\mathfrak{D} \subseteq \mathscr{A}^*$ be $\mathrm{Disc}(\mathscr{X}|_{\mathscr{A}^*})$. Let $t \in T_k$ be a $k$-point such that $\overline{\varphi}_t$ satisfies the conclusion of Lem.~\ref{lem: thread the needle}. In particular, we may choose a $W$-lifting $\widetilde{t}$ of $t$ such that $\overline{\varphi}^*_{\widetilde{t}}(\overline{\mathfrak{D}})$ is finite \'etale over $W$. Since the choice of such $\widetilde{t}$ is open dense in the set of all $W$-liftings of $t$, Lem.~\ref{lem: FAP for curves} allows us to choose $\widetilde{t}$ such that, after we choose an embedding $W \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$, the image $\varphi_{\widetilde{t}}(\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C})$ has the following properties: The restriction of $\mathscr{X}$ to $U_\mathbb{C} := \varphi_{\widetilde{t}}(\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C}) - \mathfrak{D}_\mathbb{C}$ satisfies $(\heartsuit)$ and $U_\mathbb{C}$ does not lie on the Noether-Lefschetz loci of $\mathsf{M}_\mathbb{C}$. Now we conclude by Lem.~\ref{lem: pencil no gl sec} and Thm~\ref{thm: TateStrong}. 
\end{proof}
