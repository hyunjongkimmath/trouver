In this appendix, we study examples of discriminant varieties defined over a DVR of mixed characteristic $(0, p)$ which become nonreduced modulo $p$ by applying the Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich (GOS) formula. We heartily thank Daichi Takeuchi for generously sharing his insights. In particular, the observations on how to apply Saito's lemma \cite[Lem.~5.4]{Saito2} and Beilinson's theorem \cite[Thm~1.7]{Beilinson} are due to him. 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let us first introduce two notations:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\upshape{(\alph*)}]
    \item Let $X, Y$ be subvarieties of a smooth $k$-variety $Z$ that intersect properly at a $k$-point $z \in Z$. Denote the intersection multiplicity of $X, Y$ at $z$ by $(X, Y)_{Z, z}$. 
    \item Let $S$ be a smooth $k$-curve and let $f : X \to S$ be a morphism from another smooth $k$-variety $X$. Let $x \in X$ be an isolated singularity on the fiber $X_{f(x)}$, and assume that there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ in $X$ such that $U\to S$ is smooth away from $x$. We denote the Milnor number of $f$ at $x$ by $\mu(f, x)$. 
\end{enumerate}
We remark that both definitions are obviously local, so to apply these definitions one may replace the varieties by open neighborhoods of the points in question. 

As usual, by a line in a projective space over $k$ we mean an one-dimensional linear subspace. 

We recall the following well known result in local Lefschetz theory: 
%\begin{proposition}
%\emph{(\cite[\S4.2]{WeilI})}
%Let $f : X \to S$ and $x$ be as in $(b)$ as above. Assume that $f$ is proper and is smooth away from $x$. Let $n := \dim X - 1$ and $\ell$ be a prime different from $\mathrm{char\,}k$. Then $\mathbb{R}^i f_* \mathbb{Q}_\ell$ is locally constant for each $i \neq n$, and $\mathbb{R}^n f_* \mathbb{Q}_\ell$ is tamely ramified whenever $\mathrm{char\,} k \neq 2$ or $n$ is odd.
%\end{proposition}
