Katz provided the following non-example of Lefschetz embebdding: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p > 2$. Let $X$ be the smooth hypersurface of $\mathbb{P}^r = \mathrm{Proj\,}k[x_0, \cdots, x_r]$ defined by the equation 
$$ F = x_0^{p^m + 1} + x_1^{p^m + 1} + \cdots + x_r^{p^m + 1}, $$
for some natural number $m \ge 1$. Katz took $m = r$, but this is not important. Again let $N$ denote the conormal bundle of $X$ in $\mathbb{P}^r$. Since $X$ is a smooth hypersurface, it is naturally identified with $\mathbb{P}(N)$. The natural morphism $\mathbb{P}(N) \to \check{\mathbb{P}}^r$ can be identified with the Gauss map 
$$ (x_0, \cdots, x_r) \mapsto (\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_0}, \cdots, \frac{\partial F}{\partial x_r}) = (x_0^{p^m}, \cdots, x_r^{p^m}), $$
which in this case is simply the $m$-power of the absolute Frobenius morphism (if we identify $\mathbb{P}^r$ with $\check{\mathbb{P}}^r$ using the chosen coordinates in the natural way). By \cite[{\S}XVII~Cor.~3.5.0]{SGA7II}, the embedding $X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^r$ is not a Lefschetz embedding.
