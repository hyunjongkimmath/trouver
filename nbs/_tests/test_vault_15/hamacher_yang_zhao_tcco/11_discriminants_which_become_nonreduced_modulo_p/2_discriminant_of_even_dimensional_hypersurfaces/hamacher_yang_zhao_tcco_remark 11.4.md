# Topic[^1]
\begin{remark}
The usage of the formula in \cite[{\S}XVI~Prop.~2.1]{SGA7II} is equivalent to the usage of the Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich (GOS) formula. Indeed, the GOS formula states (\ref{eqn: global Milnor formula}) when the Milnor number $\mu(\mathcal{X}_L/L, x')$ is replaced by the total dimension $n(x')$ of vanishing cycles at $x'$, but $\mu(\mathcal{X}_L/L, x') = n(x')$ by Milnor's formula (see Thm~2.4 in \textit{loc. cit.}), whose proof in fact proceeds by comparing the GOS formula with \cite[{\S}XVI~Prop.~2.1]{SGA7II}.
