# Topic[^1]

The theorem above recovers Prop.~2.12 and partially recovers Thm~4.3 in \cite{Saitodisc}. Note that it in addition implies that the polynomial $A$ in \cite[Thm~4.3]{Saitodisc} is actually irreducible over $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_2$. As far as the authors are aware of, this statement is new in literature.
