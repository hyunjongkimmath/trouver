Let $L \subseteq \check{\mathbb{P}}$ be a line and denote the corresponding pencil of hypersurfaces by $p_L : \mathcal{X}_L \to L$. Let $A_L$ be the intersection of all hyperplanes parametrized by $L$. We will always assume that $X$ intersects $A_L$ transversely. In this case, the total space of $\mathcal{X}_L$ is obtained as the blow up of $X$ along $X \cap A_L$.
\begin{comment}
    In fact, for this statement alone it suffices to assume that $X$ meets $A_L$ properly. See e.g., the paragraph above \cite[Lem.~5.1]{Saito2}.
\end{comment}
Let $\mathcal{X}_L^\circ$ be the complement of the exceptional locus. Note that we may view $\mathcal{X}_L^\circ$ as an open subvariety of $X$.
