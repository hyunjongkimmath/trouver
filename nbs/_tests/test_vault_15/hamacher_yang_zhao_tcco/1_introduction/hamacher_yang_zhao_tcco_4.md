% That $\mathsf{M}$ is connected implies that $\mathsf{M}_\mathbb{Q}$ is connected: Suppose that $\{ p_0, \cdots, p_r \}$ is a set such that there exists a nontrivial idempotent $e$ in $\mathsf{M}[1/(p_0 \cdots p_r)]$ and assume that $r$ is minimal for such a set to exist. Let $\mathsf{M}'$ be $\mathsf{M}[1/(p_1 \cdots p_r)]$. Then by assumption $\mathsf{M}'$ is connected. We then apply stacks project Tag 055C to $\mathsf{M}' {\otimes} \mathbb{Z}_{(p_0)}$.  

The base $\mathsf{M}$ in Thm~\ref{thm: generic} should be thought of as the moduli of varieties of a certain type, or obtained from a complex $h^{2, 0} = 1$ variety by spreading out. %In either case, it is natural to assume that $\mathsf{M}$ is defined over (an open part of) $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$.

Next, we illustrate through examples that for concrete families we can often give explicit lower bounds on $p$ in the theorem above for the Tate conjecture to hold.

\paragraph{New case of BSD} The Tate conjecture for elliptic surfaces is particularly interesting, as it is equivalent to the BSD conjecture for elliptic curves over function fields. Let $C$ be a smooth proper curve over a field $k$ with algebraic closure $\bar{k}$. The minimal non-singular compactification of an elliptic curve $\mathcal{E}$ over $k(C)$ is an elliptic surface $\pi \colon X \to C$. Let $L$ be the \textit{fundamental line bundle} (i.e., the dual of $\mathbb{R}^1 \pi_* \mathcal{O}_X$) and let $\mathrm{ht}(\mathcal{E}) \coloneqq \mathrm{deg}(L)$ denote the height of $\mathcal{E}$. Consider the irreducible components of the singular fibers of $\pi$ and let $\epsilon(\mathcal{E})$ be the number of those components which do not meet the zero section. In particular, $\epsilon(\mathcal{E}) = 0$ if and only if all singular fibers are irreducible (and hence also geometrically irreducible). The Shioda-Tate formula tells us that if $k = \bar{k}$, then the Mordell-Weil rank $\mathrm{MW}(\mathcal{E})$ of $\mathcal{E}$ and the Picard number $\rho(X)$ of $X$ are related by
$$ \rho(X) - 2 = \mathrm{MW}(\mathcal{E}) + \epsilon(\mathcal{E}). $$
