# Topic[^1]
\begin{remark}
Every class of general type surface in Moonen's list \cite[Thm~9.4]{Moonen}, except possibly type (b), has a parameter space with a natural relative compactification structure as described in Step I+, and hence is amenable to similar analysis. We picked a class where the defining equations of the varieties are manageable to illustrate ideas, but will provide more examples in future work. 
\end{remark}
