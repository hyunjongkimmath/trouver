\begin{theorem}
\label{thm: generic}
\emph{(Genericity Theorem)}
Let $\mathsf{M}$ be a connected scheme which is smooth, separated, and of finite type over $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ and let $f \colon \mathscr{X} \to \mathsf{M}$ be a smooth projective family of varieties. If the restriction of $\mathscr{X}$ to $\mathsf{M}_\mathbb{Q}$ satisfies property $(\heartsuit)$, and the $\mathbb{C}$-fibers of $\mathscr{X}$ have Hodge number $h^{2, 0} = 1$, then for $p \gg 0$, every fiber of $\mathscr{X}$ over a closed point of residue characteristic $p$ satisfies the Tate conjecture in codimension $1$. 
\end{theorem}
