# Topic[^1]


We remark that $\epsilon = 0$ is an open dense condition on the moduli stack $\mathscr{M}$ of elliptic surfaces with $g(C)=\mathrm{ht}(\mathcal{E})=1$, so this condition is generically satisfied. The current evidence for function field BSD seems to be extremely meager: It is known when the elliptic surface is isotrivial, rational, or is a K3 surface (\cite{ASD}), or when the $L$-function vanishes to order $1$ (\cite{Ulmer}). As far as the arthors are aware of, there are no more systematic results on the conjecture only conditional on some simple invariants. 

\paragraph{Surfaces with $p_g = K_X^2 = 1$} To illustrate our method, we also analyze a class of surfaces of general type. For a proper algebraic surface $X$ over a field, we use $K_X$ to denote the canonical divisor and $p_g$ the geometric genus $\mathrm{H}^0(X, K_X)$.
