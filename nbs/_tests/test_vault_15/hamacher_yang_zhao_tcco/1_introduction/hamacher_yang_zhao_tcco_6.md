Over $\mathbb{C}$, surfaces with invariants $p_g = K_X^2 = 1$ were classified by Catanese (\cite{Catanese0}). They are simply connected, have a coarse moduli space of dimension $18$ and were among the first examples for which both the local and the global Torelli theorem fail (\cite{Catanese}). 

\paragraph{Gushel-Mukai Varieties} There are no Fano surfaces for which the Tate conjecture is interesting because they are all rational. However, we can test our method on a class of higher dimensional Fano varieties, called Gushel-Mukai varieties. These varieties come in dimensions $3, 4, 5, 6$, and we may view the even dimensional ones as $h^{2, 0} = 1$ varieties by applying a Tate twist to their middle cohomology.
