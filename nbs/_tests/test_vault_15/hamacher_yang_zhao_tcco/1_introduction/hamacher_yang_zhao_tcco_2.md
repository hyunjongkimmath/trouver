The past decade witnessed great progress on the Tate conjecture in codimension $1$ for varieties with $h^{2, 0} = 1$. For K3 surfaces over finite fields, Maulik (\cite{Maulik}), Madapusi-Pera (\cite{MPTate}), and Charles (\cite{Charles}) settled the remaining supersingular case left open by Nygaard-Ogus (\cite{NO}). In characteristic $0$, Moonen proved the Tate (and Mumford-Tate) conjecture for more or less arbitrary smooth projective varieties with $h^{2, 0} = 1$, as long as they satisfy a mild property $(\heartsuit)$, which we recall below. The goal of the paper is to achieve this over finite fields.
