# Topic[^1]
\begin{remark}
The above proof is inspired by that of \cite[Prop.~6.6]{Moonen}, which also uses non-emptyness properties of Hodge loci. However, there are some key differences. Unlike the proof in \textit{loc. cit.}, we do not prove that the Hodge cycle in question $(f_B, f_{\mathrm{dR}, \mathbb{C}})$ has the desired properties by finding a point where it is known to be algebraic (i.e., motivated), although we do leverage the algebraicity of certain classes in the domain of $(f_B, f_{\mathrm{dR}, \mathbb{C}})$ when it viewed as a morphism. As a result, we are not able to use the above argument to show that $(f_B, f_{\mathrm{dR}, \mathbb{C}})$ remains rational under $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{C})$. It seems to us that for a Hodge cycle, being absolute Hodge is a condition which is more transcendental in nature than being absolute de Rham, due to this requirement of rationality.
