# Topic[^1]


We remark that this conjecture is essentially a compatibility statement about the classical Riemann-Hilbert correspondence (which produces $\mathfrak{z}_{\mathrm{dR}, \mathbb{C}}$ out of $\mathfrak{z}_B$) and the $p$-adic version. Therefore, it is an analogue of \cite[Conj.~1.4]{DLLZ}, except that the question is not about local systems themselves but about global sections. 

We now prepare to prove Thm~\ref{thm: comparison is dR}, which is a special case of Conj.~\ref{conj: de Rham}.
