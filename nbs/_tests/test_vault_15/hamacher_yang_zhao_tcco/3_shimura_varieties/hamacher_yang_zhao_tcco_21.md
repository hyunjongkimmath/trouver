\label{sec: Shimura}
%Throughout this section, we fix a Shimura datum of Abelian type $(G,\Omega)$ which satisfies Milne's additional axioms SV2\textsuperscript{*} and SV4-6 (cf.~\cite{MilIntro}). In this paper all Shimura data satisfy these additional criteria. 


Let $(G, \Omega)$ be a Shimura datum. As usual, we say that it is of Hodge type if there exists an embedding $(G, \Omega) \hookrightarrow (\mathrm{GSp}(H, \psi), \mathcal{H}^\pm)$ where $(H, \psi)$ is a symplectic space over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathcal{H}^\pm$ is the associated Siegel double space. Let $w_\Omega$ denote the weight and $E := E(G, \Omega)$ denote the reflex field. Let $\tau_0 : E \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be the embedding which restricts to the identity. Let $\chi_\infty$ be the set of all embeddings of $E$ into $\mathbb{C}$ and for each $\tau \in \chi_\infty$ let $\mathbb{C}_{\tau}$ denote $E {\otimes}_{\tau} \mathbb{C}$, i.e., the field $\mathbb{C}$ but with $E$ acting through $\tau$. In particular, $\mathbb{C} = \mathbb{C}_{\tau_0}$. For $\sigma \in \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{C})$, we set $\sigma(\tau) := \sigma^{-1} \circ \tau$.  

% We say that $(G, \Omega)$ is adjoint-to-Hodge type if it is the adjoint Shimura datum to one of Hodge type. 

For any compact open subgroup $K \subset G(\mathbb{A}_f)$ we denote by $\mathrm{Sh}_K(G,\Omega)$ the canonical model of the Shimura variety of level $K$. Moreover, we set
\[
 \mathrm{Sh}(G,\Omega) \coloneqq \varprojlim_{K} \mathrm{Sh}_K(G,\Omega).
\]

Let $Z \subseteq G$ denote the center. In this section, we put the \textit{standing assumption} that either $(G, \Omega)$ is of Hodge type and satisfies the additional axiom (SV5) (i.e., $Z(\mathbb{Q})$ is discrete in $Z(\mathbb{A}_f)$), or is the adjoint Shimura datum to some $(\widetilde{G}, \widetilde{\Omega})$ of Hodge type and satisfies (SV5). 

% For future note: $\widetilde{\Omega} \to \Omega$ is surjective on connected components. See Moonen. 

\paragraph{Notation} For any vector space $M$, let $M^{\otimes}$ denote the direct sum of all the vector spaces that can be obtained from $M$ by taking duals, tensor products, symmetric powers and exterior powers. We use the same notation also for any object $M$ for which $M^{\otimes}$ makes an obvious sense.
