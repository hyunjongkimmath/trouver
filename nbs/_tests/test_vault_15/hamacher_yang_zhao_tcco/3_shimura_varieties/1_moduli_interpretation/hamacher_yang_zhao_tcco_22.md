 \label{ss: moduli interpretation}

In this subsection we recall and mildly extend Milne's construction of the canonical model as moduli spaces from \cite[\S3]{Mil94}. We note that Milne put a simplifying assumption that there exists a morphism $t : G \to \mathbb{G}_m$ such that $t \circ w_\Omega = 2$. If $(G, \Omega)$ is of Hodge type, this is automatically satisfied, but may not or may not be satisfied by the adjoint Shimura datum of $(G, \Omega)$. 

%Then there exists a collection of tensors $\{ s_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in I}$ on $V^{\otimes}$ such that the image of $G$ can be identified with the stabilizer of $(s_\alpha)$. 

% We assume that there exists a component $s_0$ of $(s_\alpha)$  such that $s_0$ or $-s_0$ is a polarization for $(V, h_x)$ for all $x \in \Omega$.
Let $\xi\colon G {\hookrightarrow} \mathrm{GL}(V)$ be a faithful representation which realizes $G$ as the stabilizer of a collection of tensors $(s_\alpha)_{\alpha \in I} \subseteq V^{\otimes}$.
