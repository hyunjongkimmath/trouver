\begin{theorem}  \label{thm: Moonen}
Let $\mathscr{X}$ be a maximally polarized family of $h^{2, 0} = 1$ varieties over a connected smooth $\mathbb{C}$-variety $S$ which satisfies $(\heartsuit)$. Let $E$ be the endomorphism field of $\mathfrak{p}^2(\mathscr{X}/S)$. Let $s \in S$ be any $\mathbb{C}$-point. Write $X$ for $\mathscr{X}_s$ and $\mathfrak{p}$ for $\mathfrak{p}^2(X)(1)$. 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\upshape{(\alph*)}]
    \item The action of $E$ on $\mathfrak{p}$ is given by motivated cycles. 
    \item If $E$ is totally real, $\dim_E \omega_B(\mathfrak{p}) \neq 4$, and $\dim_E \omega_B(\mathfrak{p})$ is odd, then $\mathrm{Nm}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(\mathfrak{p}_s) {\otimes} \mathrm{det}(\mathfrak{p}_{s, {(\IQ)}})$ is an object of $\mathsf{Mot}^\mathsf{Ab}(\mathbb{C})$. 
    \item If $E$ is totally real, and $\dim_E \mathrm{T}(X) = 4$, $\mathrm{Nm}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(\mathfrak{p}_s)$ is an object of $\mathsf{Mot}^\mathsf{Ab}(\mathbb{C})$. 
    \item If $E$ is CM, then $\mathfrak{p}_s$ is an object of $\mathsf{Mot}^\mathsf{Ab}_\mathrm{AH}(\mathbb{C})$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The first three statements follow directly from results in \cite{Moonen}. (a) is Prop.~6.6, (b) is stated in the last sentence of \S5.4 and (c) is a direct consequence of Prop.~8.2. We only need to explain (d). As explained in \S7.4 of \textit{loc. cit.}, there exists a motive $\mathfrak{u}$ equipped with an $E$-action such that $\omega_B(\mathfrak{u}) \,{\cong}\, E$ and $\mathfrak{p} {\otimes}_E \mathfrak{u} = \mathfrak{h}$ for some $\mathfrak{h} \in \mathsf{Mot}_\mathsf{Ab}$. Note that the motive $\mathfrak{u}$ is independent of $s$. It suffices to show that $\omega_B(\mathfrak{u})$ is spanned by absolute Hodge classes. By the proof of \cite[Lem.~7.5]{Moonen}, for some $s \in S$, the algebraic part $\omega_B(\mathfrak{p})^{(0, 0)}$ of $\omega_B(\mathfrak{p})$ is nonempty. Since every class in $\omega_B(\mathfrak{u})$ is of type $(0, 0)$, we have $\omega_B(\mathfrak{p})^{(0, 0)} {\otimes}_E \omega_B(\mathfrak{u}) = \omega_B(\mathfrak{h})^{(0, 0)}$. As every class in $\omega_B(\mathfrak{p})^{(0, 0)}$ and $\omega_B(\mathfrak{h})^{(0, 0)}$ is absolute Hodge, we may now conclude by Prop.~\ref{prop: N is abs Hdg} below. 
\end{proof}
