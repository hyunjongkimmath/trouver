%Uniqueness holds since $\mathscr{P}ic_{\mathcal{X}/S}$ is separated. As it is finitely presented, every line bundle $\xi$ on $\mathcal{X}_\eta$ extends to $\mathcal{X}_U$ for some open subscheme $U \subseteq S$, which we can further extend to $\mathcal{X}$ (see e.g.\cite[Prop.~II.6.5]{Hartshorne}), proving existence.% . By \cite[Err\textsubscript{IV} Cor.~21.4.13]{EGAIV4}, any two extensions differ by the pullback of a line bundle on $S$, so the extension gives a well defined class in $\mathscr{P}ic_{\mathcal{X}/S}(S)$. 

% I changed the proof back to using EGA because the representability and separatedness of the relative Picard functor need a reference. The original reference due to Grothendieck added many assumptions for this to be true, so I avoided it just for convenience. 

For a lattice-polarized family $\mathscr{X}/S$ we denote by $\mathfrak{p}^2(\mathscr{X}/S) \in \mathsf{Mot}(S)$ the second primitive motive (if $S$ is defined over a characteristic $0$ field) and use $\mathrm{PH}^2(-)$ for the primitive cohomology modules. We note that for a maximally polarized family $\mathscr{X}$ over a connected smooth $\mathbb{C}$-variety $S$, there is no algebraic class in $\mathrm{PH}^2(\mathscr{X}_s, \mathbb{Q})$ when $s$ is a Hodge-generic point (cf. \cite[31]{Moonen-Fom}).


 The following statements are the key inputs we will use from Moonen's paper
%Now we summarize the geometric input we need to import from Moonen's paper.
