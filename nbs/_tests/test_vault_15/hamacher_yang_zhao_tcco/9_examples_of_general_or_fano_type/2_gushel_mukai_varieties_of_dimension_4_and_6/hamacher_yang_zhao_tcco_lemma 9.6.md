# Topic[^1]
\begin{lemma}
The period morphism defined by the $\mathbb{Q}$-VHS on $\mathbb{V}_B$ over $\mathsf{M}_\mathbb{C}$ is dominant. For a general $b \in B_\mathbb{C}$, the period morphism does not contract the fiber $\mathsf{M}_b$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The fact that the period morphism is dominant can be seen in \cite{DK}. Note that $B_\mathbb{C}\cong \mathrm{Gr}(n + 5, 11)$, hence is of dimension 18 when $n=4$ and is a point when $n=6$. On the other hand, the period domain is 20 dimensional. So a generic fiber cannot be contracted by the period morphism.
\end{proof}
