The definition of a Lefschetz embedding is taken from \cite[\S XVII, 2.3]{SGA7II}. The proposition is an analogue of Thm~2.5.1 in \textit{loc. cit.} for the particular weighted projective space of our interest. The proof is essentially the same, except that one has to pay attention to the degree of variables. 


Let $B \subseteq \mathbb{A}^{13}$ be the open subscheme which parametrizes $(\alpha, F)$ such that the hypersurface defined by (\ref{eqn: Todorov canonical equation}) has isolated singularities. Let $\mathscr{P}$ be the trivial projective bundle $|\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{P}(6)| \times B$ over $B$. Let $\mathsf{M} \subseteq \mathscr{P}$ be the open subscheme consisting of points $(H, H_0) \in |\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{P}(6)| \times_S B$ such that $H \cap H_0$ is non-singular. Let $\overline{\mathscr{X}} \to \mathscr{P}$ be the natural family given by $H \cap H_0$. Then every admissible surface of general type with $p_g = K^2 = 1$ and $q = 0$ defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p > 3$ can be found as the fiber over a geometric point on $\mathsf{M}$. Let $\mathfrak{D}$ be the complement of $\mathsf{M}$ in $\mathscr{P}$, equipped with a reduced scheme structure, i.e., $\mathrm{Disc}(\overline{\mathscr{X}}/\mathscr{P})$. 

Over $\mathbb{C}$, the second primitive cohomology is polarized by $K$. As the intersection pairing on the second singular cohomology is unimodular, and $K^2=1$, we know the discriminant of the second primitive Betti cohomology is $1$. Also since the period morphism is dominant to the period domain, we know that for a very general surface, its primitive cohomology does not contain any nonzero Hodge classes. Hence there are no more line bundles on a very general surface other than the polarization. Therefore, we polarize the family $\mathscr{X}/\mathsf{M}$ only by the canonical bundle and let $\mathbb{V}_\ell$ denote $\mathrm{PH}^2_\mathrm{{\acute{e}}t}(\mathscr{X}/\mathsf{M}, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)$.
