In this section, we consider algebraic surfaces of general type with invariants $p_g=K^2=1$ and irregularity $q=0$ over an algebraic closed field of characteristic 0 or $p>3$. We recall the construction of such surfaces and their period mapping.

Over complex number field, such surfaces are classified in \cite{Catanese,Todorov}. The upshot is that the canonical model of such a surface $S$ can be realized as a $(6,6)$ complete intersection in the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}(1,2,2,3,3)$. This canonical model has at most rational double points as singularities. Let $(x_0,x_1, x_2,x_3,x_4)$ be the coordinates of $\mathbb{P} \coloneqq \mathbb{P}(1,2,2,3,3)$. As proved in \cite[Prop.~1.8]{Catanese}, the canonical model can be given by two equations of the following form: 
\begin{align}
\label{eqn: Todorov canonical equation}
x_3^2+x_0 x_4\alpha(x_0^2,x_1,x_2)+F(x_0^2,x_1,x_2)=0
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ is a linear form, and $F$ is a cubic form. For generic choice of two equations as above, the resulting canonical model is smooth and hence isomorphic to $S$. For convenience, we introduce the following definition.
