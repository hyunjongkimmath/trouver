In characteristic $p>3$, the classification result still holds. In fact, the only ingredient in \cite{Catanese} that requires characteristic 0 is \cite{Bombieri}, which states that the linear series $|4K_S|$ is base point free. This is shown to hold in positive characteristic by \cite{Ekedahl}.


Note the following facts over $\mathbb{C}$: first, these surfaces are known to be simply connected \cite{Todorov}, hence the second integral cohomology group is torsion-free. Also, the second Betti number
$$b_2=22-8q-K^2=21.$$
The primitive Hodge structure is polarized by $K$, hence the intersection paring has discriminant 1.
