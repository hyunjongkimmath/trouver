# Topic[^1]



Now we view the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}$ as being defined over $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}[1/6])$. Consider the (relative) complete linear system $|\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{P}(6)|$, which is a projective space over $S$. Note that by the preceeding lemma, $\mathcal{O}_\mathbb{P}(6)$ is very ample.
