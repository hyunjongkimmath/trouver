\label{sec: period AM case}
We first treat the simple case when the family of motives $\mathfrak{p}^2(\mathscr{X}/S)$ is an object of $\mathsf{Mot}_\mathrm{AH}^\mathsf{Ab}(S)$. Note that by Thm~\ref{thm: Moonen} this is automatically satisfied when $E$ is a CM field. Let $\delta \in \det(V)$ be any nonzero element. Note that the standard reprensentation of $G$ realizes $G$ as the stabilizer of the quadratic form on $V$ as well as $\delta$. As $\mathfrak{p}^2(\mathscr{X}_b)$ is an object of $\mathsf{Mot}^\mathsf{Ab}_\mathrm{AH}(\mathbb{C})$, $\psi_*(\delta)$ defines an element of $\det(\mathfrak{p}^2(\mathscr{X}_b))$. Moreover, as this element is $\pi_1^\mathrm{{\acute{e}}t}(S, b)$-invariant, it globalizes to a relative cycle $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ in $\wedge^n \mathfrak{p}^2(\mathscr{X}/S)$. Since the monodromy representation of $\pi_1^\mathrm{{\acute{e}}t}(S, b)$ factors through $K$ via $\psi$, we may extend $\psi$ to a $K$-level structure $\widetilde{\psi}$ on $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbb{A}_f}$. Let $\eta_\mathrm{std}$ be the tautological level structure on $\mathbf{V}_{\mathbb{A}_f}$. 

By Prop.~\ref{prop: moduli over E}, there exists a period morphism $\rho \colon S \to \mathrm{Sh}(G)$ characterized by the property that there is an isometry $\rho^*(\mathfrak{V}) \stackrel{\sim}{\to} \mathfrak{p}^2(\mathscr{X}/S)$ which sends $\widetilde{\delta}$ to $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ and $\eta_\mathrm{std}$ to $\widetilde{\psi}$. Then clearly this $\rho$ satisfies the conclusion of Thm~\ref{thm: period}. In fact, the isomorphisms $\alpha_B^\circ$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{dR}, \mathbb{C}}^\circ$ are given by restrictions to $S_\mathbb{C}^\circ$ of isomorphisms $\rho_\mathbb{C}^*(\mathbf{V}_B) \stackrel{\sim}{\to} \mathbf{P}_B$ and $\rho^* \mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{dR}, S_\mathbb{C}} \stackrel{\sim}{\to} \mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{dR}, S_\mathbb{C}}$ which are defined over the entire $S_\mathbb{C}$.
