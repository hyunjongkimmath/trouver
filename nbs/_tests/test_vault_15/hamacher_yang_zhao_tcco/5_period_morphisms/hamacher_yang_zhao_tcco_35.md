Note that for any $K$, the hypothesis can be satisfied by replacing $S$ by a connected finite \'etale cover, and by \'etale descent arguments, we may always assume that $K$ is sufficiently small.

%\begin{remark}
%The construction of the period morphism for the moduli of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces involves passing to a double ``orientation'' cover (cf. \cite[Thm~5]{MPTate}). In our context, such an orientation would be defined as an isometry $\underline{\det(V)} \stackrel{\sim}{\to} \det(\mathbf{P}_2)$, where $\underline{\det(V)}$ is the constant sheaf on $S$ defined by $\det(V)$. Technically, one needs some ``independence of $\ell$'' result about the monodromy action on determinants like \cite[Lem.~3.2]{Saitodisc} (see also \cite[Cor.~5.9]{Taelman2}), so that a $2$-adic orientation induces an $\ell$-adic orientation for every $\ell$, in order to define level structures properly (\cite[Def.~5.11, Rmk~5.12]{Taelman2}, see also \cite[\S3.3.3]{Yang}). In our paper, we use \cite[Prop.~6.14]{Larsen-Pink} in place of \cite[Lem.~3.2]{Saitodisc} to impose level structures (up to replacing $S$ by a connected \'etale cover), and we no longer talk about orientations explicitly.
