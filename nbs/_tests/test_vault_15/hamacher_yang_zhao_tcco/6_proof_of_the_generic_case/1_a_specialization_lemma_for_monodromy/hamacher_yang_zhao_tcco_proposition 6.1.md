\begin{proposition}
\label{prop: max prime-to-p quotient}
Let $G$ be a profinite group, $N \unlhd G$ be a closed normal subgroup, and $P$ by any $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$. 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\upshape{(\alph*)}]
    \item $NP / N$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G/N$.
    \item $P \subseteq N$ if and only if $G/N$ is prime-to-$p$, i.e., $p \nmid [G : N]$, where $[G : N]$ is interpreted as a supernatural number. 
    \item If $N$ is the minimal closed normal subgroup $p(G)$ of $G$ which contains one (and hence all) $p$-Sylow subgroups, then $G /N = G^{(p)}$. 
    \item If $p \nmid [G : N]$, where $[G : N]$ is interpreted as a supernatural number, then $p(G) \subseteq N$, and the natural morphism $N^{(p)} \to G^{(p)}$ is injective. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
(a) is well known for finite groups. For a reference in the generality of profinite groups, see \cite[Ex.~2.3.3]{ProfiniteGroups}. The other statements are all easy consequences of (a). 
\end{proof}
