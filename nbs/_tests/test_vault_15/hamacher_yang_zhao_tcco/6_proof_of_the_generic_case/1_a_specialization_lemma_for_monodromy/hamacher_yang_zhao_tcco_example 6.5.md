\begin{example}
\label{Ex: Shusterman}
One may naturally wonder in Prop.~\ref{prop: max prime-to-p quotient}(d), if we replace the assumption $p \nmid [G : N]$ by the assumption that $[G : N]$ is finite, we still have that the natural morphism $N^{(p)} \to G^{(p)}$ has finite kernel. If so, then the restriction on $p$ in the above lemma can be removed. Unfortunately, this is not true. Here is a counterexample, which is kindly provided to us by Mark Shusterman: Let $p = 2$, $G'$ be the additive group of $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $G$ be the semidirect product $G' \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/ 2 \mathbb{Z}$, where $\mathbb{Z} / 2 \mathbb{Z}$ acts on $G'$ by negation. Then $G' \unlhd G$ and $[G : G'] = 2$. Clearly $(G')^{(2)} = G'$. On the other hand, $G$ can be viewed as the inverse limit of the dihedral group $D_{3^n}$ (the symmetry group of $(3^n)$-gons), with $G'$ being the subgroup generated by rotations. This implies that $G^{(2)}$ is trivial, as the reflections generate the entire $G$.
