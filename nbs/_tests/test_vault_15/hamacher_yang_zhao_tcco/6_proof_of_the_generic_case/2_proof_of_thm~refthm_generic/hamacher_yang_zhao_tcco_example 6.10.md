\begin{example}\footnote{We thank Ananth Shankar and Boya Wen for informing us this example.}
\label{ex: quaternion}
We extract a well-structured non-example for Thm~\ref{thm: TateStrong} from \cite[{\S}III]{Boutot-Carayol}. For readers' convenience we follow the notations in \textit{loc. cit}. Let $\Delta$ be an indefinite quaternion division algebra over $\mathbb{Q}$ and let $\Delta^*$ denote the reductive group over $\mathbb{Q}$ defined by $\Delta^*(R) = (\Delta {\otimes}_\mathbb{Q} R)^\times$ for every $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra $R$. Let $\mathfrak{H}^\pm$ be the double upper-half plane $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C}) - \mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{R})$. Then for every compact open subgroup $U \subseteq \Delta^*(\mathbb{A}_f)$ there is a Shimura curve $S_U$, whose complex uniformization is $S_U(\mathbb{C}) = \Delta^*(\mathbb{Q}) \backslash \mathfrak{H}^\pm \times \Delta^*(\mathbb{A}_f) / U$. 

Let $p$ be a prime such that $\Delta$ ramifies at $p$ and suppose that $U = U_p^0 U^p$ where $U^p \subseteq \Delta^*(\mathbb{A}^p_f)$ and $U_p^0$ is the unique maximal compact open subgroup of $\Delta^*(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. There is a natural $\mathbb{Z}_p$-model $M_U$ of $S_U$ which admits a moduli interpretation of abelian surfaces with action by (the ring of integers of) $\Delta$ (\cite[{\S}III~3.1]{Boutot-Carayol}). Let $h : \mathscr{A} \to M_U$ be the universal family, which can be principally polarized. Honda-Tate theory implies that for every $s \in M_U(\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p)$, the fiber $\mathscr{A}_{s}$ is supersingular (\cite[{\S}III~Prop.~2]{Boutot-Carayol}), i.e., $\mathscr{A}_{\mathbb{F}_p}$ is an entirely supersingular family. By the preceeding example, even after one remove the singular points $M_U {\otimes} \mathbb{F}_p$, $M_U$ does not satisfy assumption (c) of Thm~\ref{thm: TateStrong}; moreover, one may construct a period morphism for $M_U$ just as in the proof of Thm~\ref{thm: TateStrong}, but the key flatness claim (\ref{eqn: flatness}) will no longer be true for every $\zeta$. 
\end{example}
