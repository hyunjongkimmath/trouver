\begin{remark}
\label{rmk: no good local property}
The reason that our proof does not depend on any good local property of $\rho$ is that $\widetilde{\rho}^*(\widehat{f}_\zeta)$ is always a single equation, no matter how bad $\rho$ is on the formal completions. The domain $\mathsf{M}$ itself is assumed to be smooth over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, so as along as $\widetilde{\rho}^*(\widehat{f}_\zeta)$ is not divisible by $p$, one may find a characteristic $0$ point on its vanishing. 
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
By combining Nagata's compactification and Hironaka's resolution of singularieties in characteristic zero, we can find a compactification $\bar{\mathsf{M}}$ of the generic fiber $\mathsf{M}_\mathbb{Q}$ such that the boundary $\mathfrak{D} \coloneqq \bar{\mathsf{M}} - \mathsf{M}_\mathbb{Q}$, equipped with the reduced scheme structure, is a normal crossing divisor. For some open subscheme $U$ of $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, $\bar{\mathsf{M}}$ and $\mathfrak{D}$ are defined over $U$, and $\mathfrak{D}$ becomes a relative normal crossing divisor over $U$. Now we conclude by Lem.~\ref{lem: pencil no gl sec} and Thm~\ref{thm: TateStrong}. 
\end{proof}
