Note that Kudla's Green function is not admissible.     We also obtain a non-holomorphic modular generating series with admissible Green functions, see Theorem \ref{main}, \eqref{main2}.
This has not appeared in literature yet, as far as we know.


\subsubsection{Compare with S. Zhang's  $\mathsf{L}$-lifting}
While  the normalized admissible extension is defined purely locally and at the level of divisors,  S. Zhang  \cite{Zha20}  also defined $\mathsf{L}$-liftings, which are admissible arithmetic divisor classes, of divisor classes on the generic fiber. 
In particular, the  $\mathsf{L}$-lifting of \eqref{suitable0} is modular. 
However, it is very hard to make the $\mathsf{L}$-lifting explicit (even at the level of divisor classes), since  besides the local constraintss, 
the definition  involves   Faltings heights of Shimura varieties.
