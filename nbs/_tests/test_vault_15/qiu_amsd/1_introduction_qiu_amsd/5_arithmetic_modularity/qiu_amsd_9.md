%Theorem \ref{mainint} could be regarded as the analog of the work of Bruinier,  Howard,  Kudla,  Rapoport and Yang \cite[Theorem B]{Bet}   over ${\mathbb {Q}}$ 
%(which is for a base level  and $\phi=1_{\Lambda}$, while we allow arbitrary levels and  very general test functions).
%Indeed, when $F={\mathbb {Q}}$, 
%the number ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$ is essentially the difference between our Green function    for $Z_t$ and the  automorphic Green function with Borcherds' normalization
%used in \cite[Theorem B]{Bet}.  
%However, over a general totally real field $F$, the analog of Borcherds' automorphic  Green function is missing.
%See \ref{Green functions01} for more information.  

 
% If $K=K_\Lambda$, due to the smoothness of  ${\mathcal {X}}_{K_\Lambda}$, the generating series \eqref{suitable1}    does not depend on the choice of ${\mathcal {L}}$. For, example the constant term $\left( c_1(\overline {\mathcal {L}}_{K_\Lambda}^\vee)+{\mathfrak{a}}\right)$  has the following simple description: it is the    unique ${\mathbb {C}}$-coefficient  arithmetic extension of $c_1(L_{K_\Lambda}^\vee) $   with harmonic curvature at infinite places  whose intersection with   ${\mathcal {P}}_{ K_\Lambda}$ is   $2\frac{L'(0,\eta)}{L(0,\eta)}+ \log|d_{E}|- {{\mathfrak{b}}}[F:{\mathbb {Q}}]+ \frac{[F:{\mathbb {Q}}]}{n}$.
 
\subsubsection{Non-holomorphic case} 
Using Kudla's Green function,
a non-holomorphic modular generating series was also  obtained by Bruinier,  Howard,  Kudla,  Rapoport and Yang  \cite[Theorem 7.4.1]{Bet}  over ${\mathbb {Q}}$.    Kudla's Green function   is  also defined if $t \in F^\times\backslash F_{>0}$, in which case $Z_t$ is  understood as $0$.
We have the following.
