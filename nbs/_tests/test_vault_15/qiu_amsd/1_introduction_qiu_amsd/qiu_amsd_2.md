# Topic[^1]


The study of modular forms with values in cohomology groups of Shimura varieties started from  the
work of Hirzebruch and Zagier \cite{HZ}  for  Hilbert modular surfaces. 
It was vastly generalized by    Kudla and Millson   \cite{KM3}. 
Later, Kudla \cite{Kud97} formulated the modularity conjecture for  generating series of  Chow cycles on orthogonal Shimura varieties over   totally real fields.   This conjecture extends 
the previous work of Gross, Kohnen and Zagier \cite{GKZ}  for  modular curves. 
For  divisors,   Kudla's conjecture was proved by  Borcherds  \cite{Bor}   over ${\mathbb {Q}}$,   by Yuan, S. Zhang and W. Zhang \cite{YZZ1}  in general.  


In    \cite{Kud02}\cite{Kud03}, Kudla proposed the   modularity problem for     generating series of  arithmetic Chow cycles   on 
integral models of  Shimura varieties.  The modularity is crucial for Kudla's program on arithmetic theta lifting, see loc. cit..
For divisors,
partial results are  obtained by  Kudla \cite{Kud02},  Kudla,  Rapoport and  Yang \cite{KRY2} for quaternionic Shimura curves over ${\mathbb {Q}}$,  
and Bruinier,  Howard,  Kudla,  Rapoport and Yang     \cite{Bet} for unitary Shimura varieties over   imaginary quadratic fields, without level structure.

This paper has two  purposes. First, since the arithmetic Chow group is too big to make a  precise   conjecture, we refine the  modularity problem  using S. Zhang's theory of  admissible  cycles \cite{Zha20}. We focus on the  case of divisors on unitary Shimura varieties   over   CM fields.
Second, we        prove the arithmetic modularity  when the level of the unitary Shimura variety is good  at nonsplit places and arbitrary at   split places.  
The admissibility enables us to
reduce the  arithmetic  modularity to  the modularity of the generating series of arithmetic intersection numbers of divisors and an 1-cycle. 
We identify such a generating series with an explicit  modular form, when the 1-cycle is a CM cycle.
This is our arithmetic mixed Siegel-Weil formula.
