 \subsubsection{Automorphic Green functions}\label{Green functions01}

%When $F={\mathbb {Q}}$, 
%${\mathfrak{e}}_t$ appeared in the literature, relating two Green functions, as follows. 
An automorphic Green function for $Z_t$ was  constructed by   Bruinier \cite{Bru},   Oda and Tsuzuki \cite{OT},  for  general $n$ and $F$. 
(For $n=1$ and $F={\mathbb {Q}}$, it was well-known, and used in   \cite{GZ}.)
  The automorphic Green function for $Z_t$   is admissible, and the
  difference with the
normalized admissible Green function is  $\frac{1}{n}E_t(0,\tau)$ (see \ref{Admissible Green functions}).    

In the case $F={\mathbb {Q}}$,  Bruinier \cite{Bru0}  also introduced  ``the automorphic Green function with Borcherds' normalization". 
By \cite[Proposition 2.11]{Bru0}, ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$ is   the difference between the automorphic Green function  for $Z_t$   and its version with Borcherds' normalization.

Over a general totally real field $F$,
 there is no direct generalization of  ``the automorphic Green function with Borcherds' normalization", at far as we know. Indeed, over ${\mathbb {Q}}$, it relies     on the fact that weakly holomorphic modular forms and harmonic Maass forms have Fourier expansions. But over a totally real field  $F\neq {\mathbb {Q}}$, there are no direct analogues of weakly holomorphic modular forms and harmonic Maass forms because of the Koecher principle.  (We thank Bruinier for explaining this to us.)  However, the sum of ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$ and the   automorphic Green function  (or the normalized admissible Green function) for $Z_t$ could be regarded as a  replacement of ``the automorphic Green function with Borcherds' normalization". 
 
            
\subsubsection{Kudla's Green function}\label{Green functions02}


For $F={\mathbb {Q}}$, Ehlen and Siddarth \cite{ES18} proved that 
 the difference between  ``the automorphic Green function with Borcherds' normalization" and Kudla's Green function for 
 $Z_t$ is the $t$-th  coefficient of a non-holomorphic modular form of weight $n+1$.    With our  replacement, we prove an analogous  modularity  result, see   \Cref{diff1}.  
Then  Theorem \ref{maincorint} follows from Theorem \ref{mainint}.
