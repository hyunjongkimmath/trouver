\label{The source of}
In the final part of this introduction, we discuss the constant ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$ from the analytic side (holomorphic projections) and the geometric side (Green functions). 


Our discovery of   ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$  is from studying the 
holomorphic projections of the product of  a theta series and the derivative of an Eisenstein series, in order to find a candidate of the holomorphic modular form in \Cref{masw}.
A priori, there are  two  holomorphic projections. One is purely at infinite places, which we call
``quasi-holomorphic projection" following \cite{YZZ}. The other is  global,  namely the projection to the space of holomorphic cusp forms, which  we call ``cuspidal holomorphic projection". However, neither of them fit in \Cref{masw} (the quasi-holomorphic projection is not modular, and 
the cuspidal holomorphic projection has no constant term). 
We compute the difference, which turns out to be a sum  of ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$ and  an
Eisenstein series. 
By adding $-{\mathfrak{e}}_t$ to  the quasi-holomorphic projection, equivalently   adding  the  
Eisenstein series to the  cuspidal holomorphic projection, we obtain  the
modular form in Theorem \ref{masw}.


%L2 holo auto form is  cuspidal



In the case $n=1$, the computations of holomorphic projections have  their roots in \cite{GZ}, and     the strategy we follow is outlined  in \cite[6.4.3]{YZZ}.  Moreover,  the explicit computation  was done by Yuan \cite{Yuan}.
We largely follow \cite{Yuan}.
