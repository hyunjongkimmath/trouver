\label{Refinement}


%We    refine  Kudla's arithmetic modularity  problem  using admissible  cycles. 



Let ${\mathcal {X}}$ be a regular integral model of ${\mathrm{Sh}}(V)$  and $\overline{\mathcal {L}}$  an ample hermitian    ${\mathbb {Q}}$-line bundle 
on ${\mathcal {X}}$  extending  $L$.   
An admissible  Green  function is  normalized if its harmonic projection is 0. %For  a finite place $v$ of $E$,  we analogously have    normalized admissible extension of a divisor  (with respect to  the ample line bundle $\overline {\mathcal {L}}$). 
An admissible divisor   on ${\mathcal {X}} $ is  normalized  if its   special fiber at every finite place has   intersection number 0 with 
$c_1({\mathcal {L}})^{n}$.  For a divisor $Z$ on ${\mathcal {X}}_E\simeq{\mathrm{Sh}}(V)$,
we have the unique  normalized admissible extension  $Z^{\overline\cL}$ (which is an arithmetic divisor) on ${\mathcal {X}}$. %, unique  modulo  ${\mathrm{im}} \partial+{\mathrm{im}} \bar{\partial}$ (in particular, its class in $  \widehat{\mathrm{Ch}}^1({\mathcal {X}})_{{\mathbb {C}}}$ is uniquely  determined).  
If ${\mathcal {X}}_{ {\mathcal {O}}_{E_v}}$ is smooth over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_{E_v}$, 
the restriction of  $Z^{\overline\cL}$ to ${\mathcal {X}}_{ {\mathcal {O}}_{E_v}}$  is simply the Zariski closure  of $Z$. 
The formation of  normalized admissible extension is compatible under  flat pullback and pushforward.

By the 1-dimensionality of  the kernel of  \eqref{natp},  there exists ${\mathfrak{a}}\in  {\mathbb {C}}$ and ${\mathfrak{e}}_t\in{\mathbb {C}}$ such that  
\begin{equation}  
\left( c_1(\overline {\mathcal {L}}^\vee)+{\mathfrak{a}}\right) +\sum_{t\in {F_{>0}}}\left( [ Z_t^{\overline\cL}]+{\mathfrak{e}}_t\right) q^t  
\label{suitable1}
\end{equation}
   is a holomorphic modular form  (for example, take a section of  \eqref{natp}). 
Here we understand    ${\mathbb {C}}\subset \widehat{\mathrm{Ch}}_{{\overline\cL},{\mathbb {C}}}^1({\mathcal {X}})$ as discussed below \eqref{natp}.
\begin{problem}[\Cref{theq1}] \label{pb1}
Find ${\mathfrak{a}}$  independent of $\phi$ and ${\mathfrak{e}}_t={\mathfrak{e}}_t(\phi) $ explicitly depending on $\phi$, such that \eqref{suitable1}
   is a holomorphic modular form  on ${\mathcal {H}}^{[F:{\mathbb {Q}}]}$ of parallel weight $n+1$. 
\end{problem}
 For a  more precise conjecture, see 
Conjecture \ref{conj1}.   
Some remarks  are in order.
\begin{itemize} 
\item One can remove ${\mathfrak{a}}$ by subtracting a suitable multiple of the degree of \eqref{suitable0} (which is modular and explicit, see \eqref{Proposition 4.1.5})   from \eqref{suitable1}. We   keep ${\mathfrak{a}}$ for later convenience.  
%(We remind the reader that $[Z^{\overline\cL}]$  is not globally admissible in the sense of \cite{Zha20}.)

\item  We expect   ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$ to be  decomposed into ``local components".  %When  ${\mathcal {X}}_{{\mathcal {O}}_{E_v}}$ is a ``good  model" (not necessary smooth as we will see), the $v$-component should be 0. In particular, 
The $v$-component should be 0 at all but finitely many places.
The  ``infinite component" should be independent of the model.
%\begin{itemize}\item
\item Since the formation of    the generating series  \eqref{suitable0} on the generic fiber
is compatible under  pullback (see \ref{Pullback and pushforward}),  ${\mathfrak{a}}$ and ${\mathfrak{e}}_t(\phi)$   should be independent of the choice of $K$. 

%\item However,  the generating series  \eqref{suitable0}   does not behave well under pushforward, see remark \ref{notpush}. 


\end{itemize}



%\item 
%Second, $[Z^{\overline\cL}]$  is not globally admissible in the sense of \cite{Zha20}. since our normalized admissible extensions are defined place by place (unlike the aforementioned   global  admissible extensions), there is no reason to expect that ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$ could be chosen to be 0. 
%\item Third, according to  Kudla's program, the intersection number of \eqref{suitable1} without ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$ with $c_1(\overline {\mathcal {L}}^\vee)^n$ should match the  derivative of a certain Siegel Eisenstein series,   at least for  the contribution from each finite place in the smooth case. Derivative of Eisenstein series are not holomorphic and one  should apply the so-called holomorphic projection which is purely at the infinite places (in contrast to the cuspidal holomorphic projection). Then one will not get an automorphic form. The ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$ terms are essentially  compensation  for the non-automorphy.  
% \end{itemize}



%We will only mention the determination of ${\mathfrak{a}}$ in Theorem \ref {mainint}  below  in this introduction.  Let us focus on   ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$.  




   %Moreover, Conjecture \ref{conj1} is adelic and stronger.
