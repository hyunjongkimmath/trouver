This theorem could be regarded as an
arithmetic mixed Siegel-Weil formula (up to the constant term) as we now explain. 
Consider the theta series of $U(1,1)\times  U(W)  $ associated to a hermitian lattice of a 1-dimensional hermitian subspace $W \subset V$. The   integration of the theta series  along   $U(W)\backslash U(W({\mathbb {A}}_E))$  is    an Eisenstein series  on $U(1,1)$ of weight 1. This is the  Siegel-Weil formula.
As a  trivial consequence, if we start with 
a theta  series of $U(1,1)\times  U(V)  $, but still integrate   along $U(W)\backslash U(W({\mathbb {A}}_E))$, we  get a linear combination of products   of 
Eisenstein series of weight $1$  and  theta  series of weight $n$, 
which we call  a mixed theta-Eisenstein series following \cite{YZZ}.  We call this formula a mixed Siegel-Weil formula. Theorem \ref{masw} is the arithmetic analog.  % (The   modular form  in Theorem \ref{masw} is also  explained in \ref{The source of} below.)
Such  an
arithmetic mixed Siegel-Weil formula was proposed  to us by S. Zhang.
   
  Now let us remark on the technicality in the statement of  \Cref{masw}. 
First,  we expect that   our ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$  here coincides with the ``infinite component"  in the second remark below 
  \Cref{pb1}. 
It is related to the following fact:  if $K_v=K_{\Lambda,v}$,  then ${\mathcal {X}}_{K,{\mathcal {O}}_{E_v}}$ is smooth over ${\mathcal {O}}_{E_{v}}$. (The smoothness is ``exotic" at places where $E/F$ is ramified.) 
Second,
the purpose of taking the pullback  ${\mathcal {P}}_K$ rather than using   natural CM cycles on ${\mathcal {X}}_K$ is 
to simplify certain local computations, see \Cref{uselat}.  % (in particular, we need to use admissible 1-cycles). %In 8.5.1 YZZ, no need assumption 5.4. Rather you  get an eisenstein series
 Third,  the independence  of  ${\mathcal {L}}$     is a  consequence of the smoothness and the use of ${\mathcal {P}}_K$.
\subsubsection{Improper intersections}\label{maind}

The main difficulty  of proving Theorem \ref{masw}
is to compute improper intersections. Instead of ${\mathcal {P}}_K$, we consider the difference of two CM  cycles  which  has generic degree 0. Then the generating series of  arithmetic intersection numbers is modular by the modularity of  \eqref{suitable0}.  This modularity enables us to prove Theorem \ref{masw} 
by ``switching  CM cycles"   and thus avoiding   improper intersections. 
%We refer  the reader to \ref{Strategy}  for a more detailed account  of this strategy. 
The   idea of using modularity to compute intersections is inspired by \cite{YZZ} and \cite{Zha19}.   When $F={\mathbb {Q}}$, a different method of computing  improper intersections was  used in \cite{BHY}.
