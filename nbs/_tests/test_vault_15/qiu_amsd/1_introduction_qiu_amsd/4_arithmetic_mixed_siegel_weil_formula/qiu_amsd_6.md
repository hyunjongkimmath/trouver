\label{Our results}
 
  
  \subsubsection{Models}\label{Models}  
We construct regular integral models of  ${\mathcal {X}}_K$'s over ${\mathcal {O}}_E$ (see Theorem \ref{hypothm}). %, using the work of Kisin \cite{Kisin-integral-model}, Kisin and Pappas \cite{Kisin-Pappas}, Rapoport, Smithling and W. Zhang  \cite{RSZ-arithmetic-diagonal-cycles}. 
Our construction   is largely suggested by    Liu. 

 
Assume that $E/{\mathbb {Q}}$ is tamely ramified. If $K_v$ is contained in a parahoric subgroup of $U(V(E_v))$,   
we have the normalization in ${\mathrm{Sh}}(V)$ of 
 the   parahoric level flat model of Kisin \cite{Kisin-integral-model}, Kisin and Pappas \cite{Kisin-Pappas}   over ${\mathcal {O}}_{E,(v)}$. % (without the tamely ramified condition in \cite{Kisin-integral-model}  \cite{Kisin-Pappas} qcl by luck? mention KP need E'=E? Hodge type... natual Hodge type same reflex field).   
 In particular, if $K_v$ is hyperspecial, ${\mathcal {X}}_K$ is the integral canonical model in the sense of Milne \cite{Milne-canonical} and Kisin \cite{Kisin-integral-model}.
 
 
 
For a hermitian  lattice  $\Lambda\subset V({\mathbb {A}}_F^\infty)$ of the space of  finite adelic points of $V$, let $K_\Lambda\subset U(V({\mathbb {A}}_E^\infty))$ 
be  its stabilizer.
 Under  certain local assumptions on $E,F$ and $\Lambda$ (see Assumption \ref {asmp1}, in particular $K_\Lambda$ is parabolic) and assuming  that $K\subset K_\Lambda$ is a principal congruence subgroup over  split places and the same with $K_\Lambda$ over nonsplit places,
   Rapoport, Smithling and W. Zhang 
 \cite{RSZ-arithmetic-diagonal-cycles} constructed a certain regular  PEL  moduli space   for a group closely related to $U(V)$ over the ring of integers of  a larger reflex field.  
 Expectably,  the moduli space and 
 our integral models  are closely related, as shown by Xu in Appendix B (the proof for the general level at split places was also suggested by Liu). 
Then  the above integral models over  ${\mathcal {O}}_{E,(v)}$'s  are regular and can be glued to obtain a 
regular integral model 
   ${\mathcal {X}}_K$ over ${\mathcal {O}}_E$.
    
   Replace the tameness assumption by  the assumption that $E/{\mathbb {Q}}$ is Galois or $E $ is the composition of $F$ with some imaginary quadratic field, we can still construct a regular integral model over ${\mathcal {O}}_{E,(v)}$  using \cite{Let}.  Then we   get a regular integral model 
   ${\mathcal {X}}_K$ over ${\mathcal {O}}_E$ as in the last paragraph. Moreover, if both the tameness assumption and the replacement assumption here hold, the two constructions give the same ${\mathcal {X}}_K$.


Let ${\mathcal {L}}_{K_\Lambda}$ be an ample  ${\mathbb {Q}}$-line bundle on ${\mathcal {X}}_{K_\Lambda}$, extending $L_{K_\Lambda}$.   Such an ${\mathcal {L}}_{K_\Lambda}$ exists. 
Let ${\mathcal {L}}_K$, denoted by $cL$ is $K$ is clear, be the pullback of ${\mathcal {L}}_{K_\Lambda}$ to ${\mathcal {X}}_K$.
Equip  ${\mathcal {L}}$ with  the descent of  the natural hermitian metric on the hermitian symmetric domain   uniformizing   ${\mathrm{Sh}}(V)$. 

 \subsubsection{Eisenstein series}  
Let $E(s,\tau)$ be the Siegel-Eisenstein series   on ${\mathcal {H}}^{[F:{\mathbb {Q}}]}$, associated to $\phi $.
Its $t$-th Whittaker function $E_t(s,\tau)$ has a decomposition  $$E_t(s,\tau)= W_{\infty,t} (s, \tau ) W^\infty_{t} (s ) $$  
into the infinite component and the finite component.
Here we choose the  $s$-variable so that   $E(0,\tau)$  is holomorphic  of weight $n+1$, equivalently, the infinite component 
$W_{\infty,t} (0, \tau )$ is a multiple of  $q^t$. (Then, $s=0$ is the critical point for the Siegel-Weil formula. But $s=0$ is not the center of the functional equation.)
The $t$-th Fourier coefficient    of  $E(0,\tau)$ is $\frac{E_t(s,\tau)} {q^t}$.
For the holomorphic part $  W_{\infty,t} (0, \tau )    \frac{d}{ds}|_{s=0}W^\infty_{t} (s )$  of  the derivative $ E'_t(0,\tau)$,  
we analogously define
\begin{equation}\label{intro1.3}{\mathfrak{e}}_t=\frac{ W_{\infty,t} (0, \tau )   } {q^t}\frac{d}{ds}|_{s=0}W^\infty_{t} (s )+\frac{E_t(0,\tau) } {q^t}\log {\mathrm{Nm}}_{F/{\mathbb {Q}}}t.\end{equation}
Then    ${\mathfrak{e}}_t$  is independent of $\tau$.


\subsubsection{Result} \label{Arithmetic mixed Siegel-Weil formula } 
On ${\mathcal {X}}_{K_\Lambda}$, we construct a canonical CM 1-cycle ${\mathcal {P}}_{K_\Lambda}$ in \ref{CM cycles}.


% The following theoremholds for the models before the descent (so without the  descent hypothesis  in \ref{Models}) by exactly the same proof.
