%Some of our notations in this introduction will be different from the ones in the later sections. %, where we will consistently  use adelic notations. 

Let $F$ be a totally real field and $E/F$   a CM extension.
Let
$V$ be a hermitian space over $E$ of signature $(n,1), (n+1,0),. . . ,(n+1,0)$, where $n$ is a positive integer. 
Let $V({\mathbb {A}}_F^\infty)$ be the space of  finite adelic points of $V$.
For  an open compact subgroup $K\subset U(V({\mathbb {A}}_F^\infty))$, we have a    $U(V)$-Shimura variety ${\mathrm{Sh}}(V)={\mathrm{Sh}}(V)_K$  (which could be stacky) of level $K$ defined   over $E$. 
Let
$L=L_K$ be the Hodge line bundle on ${\mathrm{Sh}}(V)$ which is ample, 

Now we introduce the generating series of special divisors.  Let $F_{>0}\subset F$ be 
the set of totally positive elements.  
For  a Schwartz function $\phi$ on $V({\mathbb {A}}_F^\infty)$ invariant by $K$ and $t\in F_{>0}$, we have a   special divisor  $Z_t=Z_t(\phi)$ on ${\mathrm{Sh}}(V)$, that is a sum of  translated Shimura subvarieties of codimension 1, weighted by $\phi$.  
Let $[Z_t]$  be  the class  of $Z_t$ in the Chow group ${\mathrm{Ch}}^1({\mathrm{Sh}}(V))_{{\mathbb {C}}}$. 
  Then 
the following generating series      \begin{equation} c_1(L^\vee)+\sum_{t\in {F>0}}[Z_t] q^t\label{suitable0}   \end{equation}
is a holomorphic modular form on ${\mathcal {H}}^{[F:{\mathbb {Q}}]}$ of parallel weight $n+1$. 
Here $L^\vee$ is  the dual of $L$,  
${\mathcal {H}}$    is the usual upper half plane and $q=\prod_{k=1}^{[F:{\mathbb {Q}}]} e^{2\pi i\tau_k}$ with $\tau=(\tau_k )_{k=1}^{[F:{\mathbb {Q}}]}\in{\mathcal {H}}^{[F:{\mathbb {Q}}]}$. 
The modularity   was proved by Liu \cite{Liu}\cite{Liu0}.

From now on,  
we assume that  ${\mathrm{Sh}}(V)$ is proper, equivalently, $F\neq {\mathbb {Q}}$  or $F={\mathbb {Q}},n=1$ and  $V $ is nonsplit at some finite place.  
By a  regular integral model  ${\mathcal {X}}$ of  ${\mathrm{Sh}}(V)$ over $  {\mathcal {O}}_E$, we   mean a regular Deligne-Mumford stack,  proper flat over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_E$ with a fixed isomorphism ${\mathcal {X}}_E\simeq {\mathrm{Sh}}(V)$.    

%Thus we have a hermitian line bundle $\overline {\mathcal {L}}$. 
     
% in the case that ${\mathcal {X}}$ has a nice moduli interpretation (at least along the intersection locus).    
 %  The idea   of reducing modularity to numeric modularity was also used in our earlier work \cite{Qiu21}
