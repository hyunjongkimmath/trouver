We recall  S. Zhang's theory of  admissible  cycles on a polarized arithmetic variety \cite{Zha20}.  
They are cycles with ``harmonic curvatures".
We only   consider admissible  divisors \cite[3.5, Admissible cycles]{Zha20}.  
In particular, for a divisor on the generic fiber, 
we have its admissible extensions. With an extra local condition, 
we have  the normalized admissible extension.
The functoriality of (normalized) admissibile cycles  under flat morphisms is important for us.



It is worth mentioning that  while  the normalized admissible extension is defined purely locally and at the level of divisors,  
a  global   lifting of a divisors class on the generic fiber  is  defined  (and it is called   $\mathsf{L}$-lifting) in  \cite[Corollary 3.5.7]{Zha20}. 
It is an  admissible  extension  \cite[Corollary 3.5.7 (1)]{Zha20} with  vanishing  Faltings height  \cite[Corollary  3.5.7 (2)]{Zha20}. They will not be further discussed in this appendix, and are not needed in this paper.

%The formulation in this appendix is from a course given by S. Zhang  in Fall 2018,  at Princeton.  and global version of   locally admissible  cycles (to be distinsguihed
