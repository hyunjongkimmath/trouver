\label{Deligne-Mumford stacks over a Dedekind domain}

Let ${\mathcal {O}}$ be  a Dedekind domain.
Let ${\mathcal {M}}$ be a regular  Deligne-Mumford stack  proper  flat over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}$ of relative dimension $n$.
Let $M$ be its generic fiber. %, and $\iota:{\mathcal {M}}_s\to {\mathcal {M}}$ the inclusion morphism. 
%We use the arithmetic intersection theory as in  \cite{Gil0}\cite{Vis}  on Deligne-Mumford stacks over $E$. 
Definitions of  cycles,   rational equivalence, proper pushforward and flat pullback for (Chow) cycles   are applicable to Deligne-Mumford stacks over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}$, see  \cite{Gil}.
Let $Z^*(M)$ (resp. $Z^*({\mathcal {M}})$) be the graded  ${\mathbb {Q}}$-vector spaces of  cycles  of $M$  (resp. $ {\mathcal {M}}$)  with ${\mathbb {Q}}$-coefficients.   
Let ${\mathrm{Ch}}^*(M)$ and ${\mathrm{Ch}}^*({\mathcal {M}})$ be the  ${\mathbb {Q}}$-vector spaces of Chow cycles .

%Arithmetic intersection theory    on  Deligne-Mumford stacks has been developed by Gillet \cite{Gil}. 
We shall only work under the   the following convenient assumption, which simplifies the local intersection theory.  For every   closed point $s\in {\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}$, let ${\mathcal {O}}_s$ be the completed local ring. 


       \begin{asmp}  \label{A11asmp11}(1) There is a finite subset $S\subset {\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}$,  
        a regular scheme  $\widetilde {\mathcal {M}}$ proper  flat over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}-S$  and a finite \'{e}tale~ morphism 
$\pi:\widetilde {\mathcal {M}}\to {\mathcal {M}}|_{{\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}-S}$ over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}-S$.

(2) For every   $s\in S$, there is a regular scheme  $\widetilde {\mathcal {M}}$ proper  flat over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_s$  and a finite \'{e}tale~ morphism 
$\pi:\widetilde {\mathcal {M}}\to {\mathcal {M}}_{{\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_s}$ over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_s$.  
\end{asmp}
 In either case (1) or (2), we call 
$\widetilde {\mathcal {M}}$   a covering of $ {\mathcal {M}}|_{{\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}-S}$ or $ {\mathcal {M}}_{{\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_s}$.
For another covering $\widetilde {\mathcal {M}}'$,   the fiber product 
is regular and proper  flat over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}-S$ or ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_s$, making a third covering. 

 A ${\mathbb {Q}}$-line bundle ${\mathcal {L}}$  on ${\mathcal {M}}$  is   ample
 if in both case (1)  and (2), its pullback to some covering is ample. And
it is 
relatively positive   if 
$  \deg {\mathcal {L}}|_ C> 0$ for every closed curve (1-dimensional  closed substack)  $C$  in every special fiber of ${\mathcal {M}}$. % (Though relative positivity is weaker in general, relative positivity implies ampleness if ${\mathcal {M}}$ is projective.)
 It is routine to check that the definition does not depend on the choice of  covering by making a third covering. 
 The following notions, which are used in the whole paper,  are also defined via   coverings: intersection number, Chern class, and  Zariski closure.
