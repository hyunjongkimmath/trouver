                       \begin{rmk}   \label{rmk123}        (1)       A Green current on Deligne-Mumford stacks is defined in  \cite[Section 1]{Gil}. 
In our situation, a        Green function is simply an orbifold function whose pullback to 
                  the  finite \'{e}tale~   cover  by  a smooth variety is a usual Green function.
           
            (2) Admissible Green functions  of $X_v$ always exists and  are the same modulo locally constant functions, and \eqref{ZZBE} is the non-archimedean analog of this fact.

        
        (3)  Analogous to
         \Cref{Laplacian equation}, by \cite[2.2]{Zha20}  a closed $(1,1)$-form  $\alpha$ is harmonic if and and only if  
                $$ \alpha \wedge  c_1\left( \overline{\mathcal {L}}\otimes_{\mathbb {Z}} {\mathbb {C}}\right) ^{n-1} \sim    c_1\left( \overline{\mathcal {L}}\otimes_{\mathbb {Z}} {\mathbb {C}}\right) ^{n}.$$
       % (3) By     \eqref{ZZBE} and the existence of admissible Green functions, the preimage of $X$ is nonempty 

\end{rmk}
