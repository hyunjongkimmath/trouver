\label{until}
       Now let ${\mathcal {O}}$ be the   ring of integers of a number field.             
                    In particular, ${\mathcal {M}}_{\mathbb {C}}:={\mathcal {M}} \otimes_{\mathbb {Z}} {\mathbb {C}}=M\otimes_{\mathbb {Q}}{\mathbb {C}}$ is a complex orbifold. 
                    Let $\overline{\mathcal {L}}=({\mathcal {L}},\|\cdot\|)$ be a hermitian   ${\mathbb {Q}}$-line bundle on ${\mathcal {M}}$   such that
 the generic fiber of ${\mathcal {L}} $ is ample,
  ${\mathcal {L}}$ is   relatively positive,  and  the hermitian metric  $\|\cdot\|$ is invariant under the involution induced by complex conjugation  
        (see \cite[3.1.2]{GS}). In particular,  endowing ${\mathcal {M}}_{\mathbb {C}} $ with the Chern curvature form $c_1\left( \overline{\mathcal {L}}\otimes_{\mathbb {Z}} {\mathbb {C}}\right)$, it is a smooth K\"ahler orbifold.
