\begin{lem}\label{fdime}(1) The natural map $\widehat{\mathrm{Ch}}^1_{{\overline\cL},{\mathbb {C}}}({\mathcal {M}}) \to {\mathrm{Ch}}^1(M) _{\mathbb {C}}$ is surjective.
Its kernel  is generated by  connected components of  special fibers of ${\mathcal {M}}$ at all  finite places and    locally constant functions on $M_{\mathbb {C}}$.

(2)        Assume that    ${\mathcal {M}}$ is   connected.  Then  the kernel of  $\widehat{\mathrm{Ch}}^1_{{\overline\cL},{\mathbb {C}}}({\mathcal {M}})\to {\mathrm{Ch}}^1(M)_{\mathbb {C}}$ 
is 1-dimensional,  and is  the pullback of $\widehat {\mathrm{Ch}}^1_{{\mathbb {C}}}\left( {\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}\right)$.
       \end{lem}
\begin{proof} 
        By  \eqref{ZZBE} and \Cref{rmk123} (2), (1) holds.  If  ${\mathcal {M}}$ is   connected, then $E_1:={\mathcal {O}}_M(M)$ is a  finite field extension of  
  the fraction field of ${\mathcal {O}}$.  Then ${\mathcal {M}}$ over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_{E_1}$ has geometrically connected fibers by Stein factorization. 
        By (1), the kernel is  the pullback of $\widehat {\mathrm{Ch}}^1_{{\mathbb {C}}}\left( {\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_{E_1}\right) $, which is 1-dimensional by the finiteness of the  class number of $E_1$ and   Dirichlet's unit theorem  (see \cite[3.4.3]{GS}).       
  And it equals   the pullback of $\widehat {\mathrm{Ch}}^1_{{\mathbb {C}}}\left( {\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}\right)$.
                              \end{proof}
