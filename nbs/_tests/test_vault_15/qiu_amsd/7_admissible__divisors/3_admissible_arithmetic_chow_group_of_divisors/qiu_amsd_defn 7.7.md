\begin{defn}[{\cite[2.3.2]{BGS}}]  \label{admextgreen}  
(1) An admissible Green  function     is   normalized   with respect to  $\overline{\mathcal {L}}\otimes_{\mathbb {Z}} {\mathbb {C}}$  if it  has vanishing harmonic projection. 

(2) An element in ${\widehat Z}^1_{{\overline\cL},{\mathbb {C}}}({\mathcal {M}})$   is normalized with respect to  $\overline{\mathcal {L}}$ if it is normalized at every  place.
  For $X\in Z^1(M)_{{\mathbb {C}}}$, let $X^{\overline\cL}\in {\widehat Z}^1_{{\overline\cL},{\mathbb {C}}}({\mathcal {M}}) $ be its normalized admissible extension with respect to  $\overline{\mathcal {L}}$. 
                  \end{defn}
