    \begin{eg} \label{admextinf}       %For  positive numbers   $c=(c_v)_{v\in \infty}$, let  $c\|\cdot\|$ be the scaling of $\|\cdot \|$ and let $\overline{\mathcal {L}}_c$ be the same line bundle with the new metric. 
          The arithmetic first Chern  class $c_1(\overline{\mathcal {L}})$ of $\overline{\mathcal {L}}$  is  the class of $ ({\mathrm{div}}(s),-\log  \|s\| ^2)$ for a nonzero rational section $s$.  By \Cref{Laplacian equation}  (or one may follow our definition), one immediately sees that ${\mathrm{div}}(s)$ has ``harmonic curvature" at every finite place.                   
                The curvature form of     $-\log  \|s\| ^2$ is by definition the K\"ahler form. So $c_1(\overline{\mathcal {L}})\in \widehat{\mathrm{Ch}}^1_{{\mathbb {C}},{\overline\cL}}({\mathcal {M}})$.
            
\end{eg}
Now we consider the functoriality. 
By Lemma \ref{pull1}, we have the following proposition.
