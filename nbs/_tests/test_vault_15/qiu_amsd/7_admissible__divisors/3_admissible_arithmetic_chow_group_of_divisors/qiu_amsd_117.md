      % The following lemma is clear from definition.
                                   
                               
                % (see also \cite[Definition 2.]{Fal}.)
%Definition \ref{admextloc} is the non-archimedean analog of the normalized admissible Green function.    
     Then the  normalized  admissible extension of  a divisor  on 
        $M$ exists  and is unique.
       
     
                   %\begin{rmk} \label{depecy}
% Note that the dependence of ${\widehat Z}^1({\mathcal {M}})_{\overline\cL}$    and normalized admissible extensions     on the metric of $\overline{\mathcal {L}}$ is determined by the curvature form of the metric.  
 

           %  \end{rmk}   
             
For every  nonzero rational function $f$ on $M$, $({\mathrm{div}}(f),-\log |f|^2)$ is contained in ${\widehat Z}^1_{{\overline\cL},{\mathbb {C}}}({\mathcal {M}})$.
