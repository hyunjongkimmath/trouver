Assume that ${\mathcal {O}}$ is   a completed local ring (so a DVR). Let $s$ be the unique closed point of ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}$.
We will use two intersection  pairings.
First,
for   $X\in Z ^i({\mathcal {M}} )$  and  $Y\in  Z^{n+1-i}({\mathcal {M}} )$
with disjoint supports on  $M$, define  \begin{equation}X\cdot Y =\frac{1}{\deg \pi} \pi^*(X)\cdot  \pi^*(Y)\in {\mathbb {Q}}\label{YZCM},\end
{equation}   
where $\pi$ is a covering morphism
and  the latter intersection number is  usual one, defined either using  Serre's ${\mathrm{Tor}}$-formula  (equivalently rephrased as  the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic of the derived tensor product ${\mathcal {O}}_{\pi^*(X)}\bigotimes^{\mathbb {L}} {\mathcal {O}}_{\pi^*(Y)}$, see \cite[4.3.8 (iv)]{GS}),  or as a cohomological pairing.
%The definition does not depend on the choice of $\widetilde{\mathcal {M}}$. Indeed,    for another covering $\widetilde {\mathcal {M}}'$, we further pullback to $\widetilde {\mathcal {M}}\times_ {\mathcal {M}} \widetilde {\mathcal {M}}'$ to check the independence. Statements below involving a covering are independent of the choice of the covering, and can be  verified in the same way, and we will omit the verifications. 


Second, 
let ${\mathcal {M}}_s$ be the special fiber of ${\mathcal {M}}$ and  $Z_s^1({\mathcal {M}} )\subset Z^1({\mathcal {M}})$ the 
subspace of divisors supported on ${\mathcal {M}}_s$. We use the intersection pairing  between $X\in Z_s^1({\mathcal {M}} )$ and an $n$-tuple of ${\mathbb {Q}}$-Cartier divisors as in \cite[Example 6.5.1]{Ful} (defined using  a covering in our situation as in \eqref{YZCM}):
\begin{equation*}Z_s^1({\mathcal {M}} )\otimes Z^{1}({\mathcal {M}} )^{\otimes n}\to {\mathbb {Q}}.\label{ZintC1}\end{equation*}
It only depends on the  rational equivalences of the Cartier divisors.

Let ${\mathcal {L}}$ be a   ${\mathbb {Q}}$-line bundle on ${\mathcal {M}}$.
%The first Chern class $c_1({\mathcal {L}})$ is the rational equivalence class of  $ {\mathrm{div}}(s)$ for a nonzero rational section $s$. 
Define $$B^1_{\mathcal {L}}({\mathcal {M}})=\ker\left( ?\cdot c_1({\mathcal {L}})^{n}:{ Z_s^{1}( {{\mathcal {M}} })}\to {\mathbb {Q}}\right).$$
Assume that the generic fiber of ${\mathcal {L}} $ is   ample  
 and   ${\mathcal {L}}$ is 
relatively positive.
The local index theorem \cite[Lemma 3.5.1]{Zha20}  (see also \cite{YZ0}) implies the following lemma.
