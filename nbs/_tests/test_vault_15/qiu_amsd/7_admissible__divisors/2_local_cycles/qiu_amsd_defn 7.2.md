\begin{defn}   \label{admextloc}  
(1) We call $Z_{\mathcal {L}}^1({\mathcal {M}} )$ the space of admissible divisors  with respect to  ${\mathcal {L}}$.


(2) For $X\in Z^1(M)$,  an admissible extension  with respect to  ${\mathcal {L}}$ is an element in  its preimage  by   $ Z_{\mathcal {L}}^1({\mathcal {M}} )\to  Z^1(M)$.   
Define the  normalized admissible extension $X^{\mathcal {L}}$ of $X$  with respect to  ${\mathcal {L}}$  to be the  projection of $X^{\mathrm{zar}}$ to $Z_{\mathcal {L}}^1({\mathcal {M}} )$ in \eqref{ZZB}.



\end{defn}
