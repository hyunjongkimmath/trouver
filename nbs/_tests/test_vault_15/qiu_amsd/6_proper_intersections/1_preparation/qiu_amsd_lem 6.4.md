\begin{lem}\label{221}For $g\in P \left({\mathbb {A}}_{F,S  }\right) G\left(  {\mathbb {A}}_F^{S \cup \infty}\right)$,
the  intersection of  the supports of $ Z_t(\omega(g)\phi)^{\mathrm{zar}} $   and $ {\mathcal {P}}_{{\mathbb {W}}  }$ on ${\mathcal {X}}_{K } $
is supported on the supersingular loci at finite places of $E$ nonsplit over $F$.  
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}  The  regularity of  $\phi$ at $S$ is preserved by the action of $P \left({\mathbb {A}}_{F,S  }\right)$ on $\phi$. 
By the regularity     of   $\omega(g)\phi $,   the claim follows from the same proof as \cite[Lemma 2.21]{KR14}  \cite[Theorem 8.5]{RSZ-arithmetic-diagonal-cycles}.% (note that the Zariski closures are always contained in the moduli extensions on the integral model).  
\end{proof}
