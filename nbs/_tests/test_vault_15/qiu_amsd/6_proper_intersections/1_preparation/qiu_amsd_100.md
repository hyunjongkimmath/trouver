\subsubsection{Decomposition  of \eqref{entryeqmod}}\label{Decomposition  of Proposition}
 As we have seen in the proof of \Cref{regmod}, for a finite place $v$ of $E$, there exists a finite unramified extension $N/E_v$ such that ${\mathcal {X}}_{K ,{\mathcal {O}}_{N}} $ is (part of) a PEL moduli space (of abelian schemes, as in \cite{RSZ-arithmetic-diagonal-cycles}), and the supersingular locus is thus defined and obviously independent of the choice of $N$.
 
 
Recall that we have the pullback CM cycle defined in \ref {PWpull}: 
\begin{equation}\label{pulleff} {\mathcal {P}}_{\mathbb {W}}=
\pi_{K,K_S K_\Lambda^S}^*{\mathcal {P}}_{{\mathbb {W}},K_S K_\Lambda^S}.\end{equation}
%\begin{rmk} \label{feature}Let us address two features of  ${\mathcal {P}}_{\mathbb {W}}$. First, we use  the pullback   rather than ${\mathcal {P}}_{{\mathbb {W}},K}$. The reason is explained in \Cref{uselat}.Second, the level does not change  over $S$. This will be explained in the next  remark.\end{rmk}
  
   %   Let $E_\Phi$ be as in \ref{RSZ-arithmetic-diagonal-cycles}. %, which is a finite unramified extension of the reflex field of the RSZ integral model.
