For a number field $F$, let  ${\mathbb {A}}_F$ be the  ring of adeles of $F$ and ${\mathbb {A}}_F^\infty$   the ring of finite adeles of $F$.   For a finite place $v$ of a number field $F$, let $\varpi_{F_v}$  be a uniformizer of $F_v$. Let $q_{F_v}$ be the cardinality of
${\mathcal {O}}_{F_v}/\varpi_{F_v}$.  The discrete valuation is $v(\varpi_{F_v})=1$ and 
the absolute value $|  \cdot |_{F_v}$ is  $|\varpi_v|_{F_v}=q_{F_v}^{-1}$.
For an infinite place, $v$ is understood as a pair of complex embeddings. If $v$ is real, the absolute value $|  \cdot |_{F_v}$ is the usual one; if $v$ is complex, the absolute value $|  \cdot |_{F_v}$ is the square of the usual one.
Their product is $|\cdot|_{{\mathbb {A}}_F}$.
The symbol $|\cdot|$ without a subscript means the usual real or complex absolute value.




Below in this paper,   $E/F$     is  always   a    CM extension. Let $\infty$ be the set of infinite places of $F$.   Let $F_{>0}\subset F$ be the subset of totally positive elements.  %Let $F_{<>0}\subset F$ be the subset of   elements negative at 1 place and positive at other places.
For  a place $v$ of $F$, $E_v$ is understood as $E\otimes _F F_v$.
The nontrivial Galois action will be denoted by $x\mapsto \overline x$ and the norm map ${\mathrm{Nm}}_{E/F}$ or its local version is abbreviated  as ${\mathrm{Nm}}$. 
Let $\eta$ be the  associated  quadratic Hecke character  of   $ F^\times\backslash {\mathbb {A}}_F^\times$ 
via the class field theory.   
%For a place $v$ of $F$, let  $\eta_v$ be  the  quadratic Hecke character  of  $F_v^\times$ associated  to the quadratic extension $E_v/F_v$. Then $\eta$ is the pure tensor of $\eta_v$'s over all places of $F$.






For a set of place  $S$ of $F$  and a decomposable adelic object $X$  
over ${\mathbb {A}}_F$, we use $X_S$ (resp. $X^S$) to denote the $S$-component (resp. component away from $S$) of $X$ if the decomposition of $X$ into the product of  $X_S$  and $X^S$ is clear from the context. %, unless otherwise specified. 
  For example, ${\mathbb {A}}_F={\mathbb {A}}_{F,S}{\mathbb {A}}_{F}^S$ and  ${\mathbb {A}}_E={\mathbb {A}}_{E,S}{\mathbb {A}}_{E}^S$ by regarding ${\mathbb {A}}_E$ as over ${\mathbb {A}}_F$.  Here is another example which is ubiquitous in the paper:  a function $\phi$ on the space of  ${\mathbb {A}}_{F}$-points of an algebraic group over $F$ that can be decomposed as 
  $\phi=\phi_S\otimes \phi^S$
  where $\phi_S$ (resp. $\phi^S$) is a function on the set of ${\mathbb {A}}_{F,S}$-points  (resp. ${\mathbb {A}}_{F}^{S}$-points) of the group.
  Note that such a decomposition of   $\phi$ is not unique.  By using these notations, we understand that we have fixed such a decomposition, see \ref{Functions} for an example.  
      If $S=\{v\}$, we write $X_v$ (resp. $X^v$) for $X_S$ (resp. $X^S$).
