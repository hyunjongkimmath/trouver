\label{hermitian spaces}All hermitian spaces are assumed to be nondegenerate.
We always use $\pair{\cdot,\cdot}$ to denote  a hermitian pairing    and $q(x)=\pair{x,x}$ the hermitian  norm if the underlying hermitian space (over $E$, $E_v$ or ${\mathbb {A}}_E$) is indicated in the context. 
For a hermitian space $V$ over $E$, we use $V$ to denote $V(E)$ to lighten the notation if there there is no confusion. 
For $t\in F$, let $V^t=\{v\in V:q(v)=t\}.$ The same notation applies to a local or adelic hermitian space.
We use  $U(V)$ for both the algebraic group $U(V)$ and its group of $F$-points.
Define $$[U(V)]=U(V)\backslash U(V({\mathbb {A}}_E)).$$


A   hermitian space  ${\mathbb {V}}/{\mathbb {A}}_E$
is called coherent (resp.  incoherent ) if its determinant belongs (resp. does not belong) to $  F^\times{\mathrm{Nm}} ( {\mathbb {A}}_E^\times)$, equivalently ${\mathbb {V}}\simeq V({\mathbb {A}}_E)$ for some (resp. no)  hermitian space $V/E$.
If ${\mathbb {V}}$ is incoherent of
dimension $1$,  for  a place $v$ of $F$ nonsplit in $E$, there is a unique hermitian space $V/E$ such $V({\mathbb {A}}_E^v)\simeq {\mathbb {V}}^v$. We call $V$ the $v$-nearby hermitian space of ${\mathbb {W}}$.   




%If $F$ is a local field, let  $|\cdot|_F$ be  the normalized absolute value, i.e. if $F$ is nonarchimedean, the value of $|\cdot|_F$ at the uniformizer is the cardinality of  the residue field of ${\mathcal {O}}_F$;   $|\cdot|_{\mathbb {R}}$ is the usual absolute value;   $|\cdot| $ is the square of the usual absolute value. Let $|x|_E=|  {\mathrm{Nm}} x|_F$. 
%of $ F\backslash {\mathbb {A}}_F$  Adelic absolute values are product of local ones.
