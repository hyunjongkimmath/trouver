%Note that $b(x,g)$ does not depend on the choice of $\nu$ above $v$. 
Note that if $q(x) $ is negative   at more than one infinite places,  then  ${\mathcal {G}}^{\mathrm{Kud}}_{Z(x)_{E_v}}(g)=0$ and $  {\mathfrak{k}}(x,g_v ) =0$ for every $v\in \infty$. 
%Note that for $g^v\in G({\mathbb {A}}_F^v)$, we have   $$ E_t'(0,gg^v,\phi)(v)=E_t'(0,g,\omega(g^v)\phi)(v)$$ by Lemma \ref{lSWlem} (2).
%, equivalently $F\neq {\mathbb {Q}}$, or $F={\mathbb {Q}},n=1$ and  ${\mathbb {V}}^\infty$ is not split at some finite place.
The following can be read from  \cite[(1.12), Theorem 1.2, (1.18), (1.19), Proposition 5.9]{GS19}.   

% and let ${\mathfrak{e}}_t(  \phi^\infty)={\mathfrak{e}}_t(1, \phi).$
