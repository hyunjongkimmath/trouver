\begin{rmk}  We may relax  Assumption \ref{asmp1} (3) by allowing   $\Lambda_v$ to be almost self-dual (see \ref{AT-parahoric-level-section}). Then   Lemma \ref{regmod}  still holds.
However, Lemma \ref{expectlem} does not hold any more.

               \end{rmk}
               
      
% For $K$ small enough,  ${\mathcal {X}}_{K  }'$ is  represented by a regular scheme.
