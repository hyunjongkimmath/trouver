%\begin{rmk} It is routine to extend the actions to $U({\mathbb {V}}_v)$ for $v\in \Sigma$. We will not need them.    \end{rmk}


      
      \subsubsection{Conjecture}\label{Conjecture}
We define generating series of admissible arithmetic divisors in two ways, essentially by choosing different Green functions. (In fact, there will be a third one in \ref{Main result}.)
The first (resp. second) definition is made toward Problem \ref{theq1} (resp. Problem \ref{theq}).

%qcl Let $\overline {\mathcal {L}}$ be the hermitian line bundle with the metric as in \ref{Complex uniformization}. 



   Recall    the holomorphic part  $E'_{t,{\mathrm{f}}}(0,g,\phi)$   of the derivative  of  $E_t(s,g,\phi)$ at $s=0$, see   \eqref{2.90}.
