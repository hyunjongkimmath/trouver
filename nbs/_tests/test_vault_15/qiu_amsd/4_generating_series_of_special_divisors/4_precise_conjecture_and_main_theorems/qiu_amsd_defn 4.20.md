# Topic[^1]
\begin{defn}(1) Let $\widetilde {\mathcal {X}}$ be the system $\{{\mathcal {X}}_K\}_{K\in {{\widetilde K_\Lambda}}}$ of integral models with transition morphisms $\pi_{K,K'}$ as in Theorem \ref{hypothm} (1)(2). 

(2) For $h\in K_\Lambda$, define the 
``right translation by $h$"  automorphism  on ${\mathcal {X}}_K$ to be action of $h$ as  in Theorem \ref{hypothm} (3).

(3)Let  $ {\mathcal {L}}_K=\pi_{K,K_{\Lambda}}^* {\mathcal {L}}_{K_{\Lambda}}$, where  
${\mathcal {L}}_{K_{\Lambda}}$ is  as in Theorem \ref{hypothm} (4). 
\end{defn}
