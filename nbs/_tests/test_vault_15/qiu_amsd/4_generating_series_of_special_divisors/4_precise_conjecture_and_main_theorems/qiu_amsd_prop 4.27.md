\begin{prop}\label{Howeext}

For a   finite place $v$ of $F$ inert in $E$ (so that $\Lambda_v$ is self-dual by \Cref{asmp1}) such that $\chi_{{\mathbb {V}},v}$  is unramified, 
the span    of   $ \{\omega(g)1_{\Lambda_v}, g\in G(F_v)\}$ is ${\mathcal {S}}({\mathbb {V}}_v)^{K_{\Lambda,v}}$. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}If $v$  has residue characteristic  $\neq2$, this is a special case of  \cite[Theorem 10.2]{Ho}. In general, let $K^{\max}_v\subset G(F_v)$  be as in \eqref{Group}.
Embedding   ${\mathcal {S}}({\mathbb {V}}_v)^{K_{\Lambda,v}\times K^{\max}_v}$ in an induced representation as \cite[(3.1)]{Ral}. It is routine to show that  ${\mathcal {S}}({\mathbb {V}}_v)^{K_{\Lambda,v}\times K^{\max}_v}$ is generated by $1_{\Lambda_v}$ as a module over the Hecke algebra of bi-$K^{\max}_v$-invariant Schwartz functions on $G(F_v)$. Then the proposition follows from
Kudla's supercuspidal support theorem for big theta lift, see \cite[Proposition 5.2]{GI}
\end{proof}
