# Topic[^1]


Under Assumption \ref{asmp1} (1.a),
for $K\in {{\widetilde K_\Lambda}}$ and a finite place $v$ of $E$, we have  an    integral model $\mathscr{S}_v$ of  ${\mathrm{Sh}}({\mathbb {V}})_{K}$ over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_{E,(v)}$, as constructed   
in \eqref{defn-mathscrS-G},  \ref{defn-mathscrS-G2} and \ref{AT-parahoric-level-section}.   (Note that we can always choose a CM type satisfying the matching condition \eqref{matching-condition}.)
 We remind the reader of the  differences between the notations on the fields here and in   Appendix B.
