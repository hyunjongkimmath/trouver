\label{Arithmetic modularity1}
 

\subsubsection{Integral models}\label{RSZ-arithmetic-diagonal-cycles}
 
 
For a finite place $v$ of $F$ and an ${\mathcal {O}}_{E_v}$-lattice ${\Lambda_v}$ of ${\mathbb {V}}_v$, the dual lattice  is defined as  $\Lambda_v^\vee=\{x\in {\mathbb {V}}_v:\pair{x,{\Lambda_v}}\subset{\mathcal {O}}_{E_v}\}$. % (It also works even if   $v$ is split in $E$.)
Then ${\Lambda_v}$ is called 
\begin{itemize}\item self-dual if     ${\Lambda_v}=\Lambda_v^\vee$;
% \item almost self-dual if     ${\Lambda_v}\subset \Lambda_v^\vee\subset \varpi_E^{-1}{\Lambda_v}$ and the first inclusion is of colength 1;
\item   $\varpi_{E_v}$-modular if $ \Lambda_v^\vee=\varpi_{E_v}^{-1}{\Lambda_v}$;
\item 
almost $\varpi_{E_v}$-modular if $ \Lambda_v^\vee\subset \varpi_E^{-1}{\Lambda_v}$ and the inclusion is of colength 1.  
\end{itemize}

Assume the following assumption in   the rest of the paper.

 \begin{asmp} \label{asmp1}  (1)  At least one of the following three conditions hold: \begin{itemize}\item[(1.a)]   every finite place   of $E$  is at most tamely ramified over $ {\mathbb {Q}}$;
 \item[(1.b)] $E/{\mathbb {Q}}$ is Galois;
 \item[(1.c)]  $E $ is the composition of $F$ with some imaginary quadratic field.
 \end{itemize}


 (2)
     Every finite place $v$ of $F$  ramified over $ {\mathbb {Q}}$ or of  residue characteristic 2 is   unramified   in $E$.



 (3)       At every  finite place  $v$ of $F$ inert    in $E$,   there is a self-dual lattice  $\Lambda_v$  in ${\mathbb {V}}_v$.
 
      
    
(4)
At every finite place $v$ of $F$ ramified in $E$, there is a  $\pi_v$-modular (resp. almost $\pi_v$-modular) lattice $\Lambda_v$  in ${\mathbb {V}}_v$ if $n$ is odd (resp. $n$ is even).  


\end{asmp}

    %    \begin{rmk} \label{infly}   

%
%(1) Under Assumption \ref{asmp1} (2),  we only need the tameness of $F$ rather than $E$ in Assumption \ref{asmp1} (1.a).

%(2)     It is desirable to remove  Assumption \ref{asmp1} (2), see for example \cite[Remark 2.69]{LL2}. In fact, in the analytic side, we do not need  Assumption \ref{asmp1} (2), see \ref{ecompositio}. 
 

 
  We classifies ${\mathbb {V}}$ containing such $\Lambda$ in   \Cref
{neven}  below. 
%\end{rmk}

At every    place  $v$  split   in $E$, let   $\Lambda_v$    be a self-dual lattice in ${\mathbb {V}}_v$. 
Let   $$\Lambda =\prod_{v } \Lambda_v\subset {\mathbb {V}}^\infty.$$
Let $$K_\Lambda\subset U({\mathbb {V}}^\infty)$$ be the stabilizer of $\Lambda$.
