 Under Assumption \ref{asmp1} (1.b) or (1.c), 
 the  reflex field    \eqref{reflex-field-E}, in our notations, is  $E$. For $K\in {{\widetilde K_\Lambda}}$ and a finite place $v$ of $E$,  both sides of 
the morphism  \eqref{map-mathcalM-Gtilde-to-mathcal-M0}
(and the   generalization  with the Drinfeld level structure as in \ref{Drinfeld level structure} or
the parahoric level structures as in\ref{AT-parahoric-level-section}) are equipped with a natural
action of the finite group $Z^{{\mathbb {Q}}}\left( {\mathbb {A}}_{\mathbb {Q}}^{\{p\}\cup \infty} \right)/Z^{{\mathbb {Q}}}({\mathbb {Z}}_{(p)})K_{Z^{{\mathbb {Q}}}}^p $   compatible with the morphism, see 
   \cite[Definition 4.2.2]{Let}. Moreover, taking quotients  by this finite group, we  get a new morphism whose target is isomorphic to ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_{E,(v)}$. Then the source of  the new morphism  is an    integral model of  ${\mathrm{Sh}}({\mathbb {V}})_{K}$ over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_{E,(v)}$, whose regularity is assured by 
   \cite{RSZ-arithmetic-diagonal-cycles} and faithfully flat descent of regularity. We also denote this    integral model by  $\mathscr{S}_v$.
  Moreover, if Assumption \ref{asmp1} (1.a) also holds, then the construction here and in  \Cref{regmod} coincides, by \ref{Corollary 2.30}.
 

We want to glue these models to obtain a regular integral model  of  ${\mathrm{Sh}}({\mathbb {V}})_{K}$ over ${\mathrm{Spec}} {\mathcal {O}}_{E}$.
