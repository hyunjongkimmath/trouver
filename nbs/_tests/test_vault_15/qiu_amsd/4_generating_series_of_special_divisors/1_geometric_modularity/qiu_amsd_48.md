\begin{rmk}\label{notpush} We have  $\pi_{K,K',*}Z(x)_K
=d(x) Z(x)_{K'}$ where $d(x)$  is the degree of $Z(x)_K$ over $Z(x)_{K'}$. It is easy to check that   $d(x)$  is  not constant near 0. In particular, it does not
extend to a smooth function on ${\mathbb {V}}^\infty$. Thus for a general $\phi$,
 there seems no $\phi'\in \overline {\mathcal {S}}\left( {\mathbb {V}}  \right)^{K'}$ such that 
$\pi_{K,K',*}Z_t(\phi)_{K}$ is  of the form $Z_t(\phi')_{K'}$ for every $t$.    

\end{rmk}


Below, let $L=L_K$, $Z(x)=Z(x)_K$, $Z_t(\phi)=Z_t(\phi)_K$ and $z(\phi)=z(\phi)_K$ for simplicity if $K$ is clear from the context.
