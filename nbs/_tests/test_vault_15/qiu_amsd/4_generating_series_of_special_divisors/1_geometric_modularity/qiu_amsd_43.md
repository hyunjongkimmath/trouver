Let ${\mathbb {V}} $ be a totally positive-definite incoherent hermitian space over ${\mathbb {A}}_E$ (with respect to  the extension $E/F$)  of dimension $n+1$ where $n$ is a positive integer.
For  an open compact subgroup $K$   of $U({\mathbb {V}}^\infty)$,
let   ${\mathrm{Sh}}({\mathbb {V}})_K$ be the associated $n$-dimensional smooth unitary Shimura variety over $E$  (see   \cite[(3.A)]{Liu}),
%\qcl{qcl (see Appendix \ref{SectionB} (1.25) }
which we allow to be a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack. 
%More precisely, the Shimura datum is  specified   in \cite{GGP}, see also \cite{RSZ-arithmetic-diagonal-cycles}. And we refer  \cite{Gro1} for the incoherent convention. 
\begin{itemize}\item
From now on, we always assume  that  ${\mathrm{Sh}}({\mathbb {V}})_K$  is proper.
\end{itemize}
Equivalently, $F\neq {\mathbb {Q}}$, or $F={\mathbb {Q}},n=1$ and  ${\mathbb {V}}^\infty$ is not split at some finite place.




\subsubsection{Simple special divisors}
Let ${\mathbb {V}}^{\infty}_{>0}\subset {\mathbb {V}}^{\infty}$ be the subset of  
$x$'s such that ${q(x)}\in F_{>0}$.  
For $x\in {\mathbb {V}}^{\infty}_{>0}$,   let $ x^\perp $ be  the orthogonal complement of ${\mathbb {A}}_E ^\infty x  $ in ${\mathbb {V}}^\infty$. Regard $U\left( x^{\perp} \right)$ as  a subgroup of $U({\mathbb {V}}^\infty)$.
Then   we have a  finite morphism  
\begin{equation}\label{finitemor}
{\mathrm{Sh}}\left( x^{\perp }\right)_{U\left( x^{\perp}  \right)\bigcap K }\to{\mathrm{Sh}}({\mathbb {V}})_K,
\end{equation}  
explicated in \cite[(2.4)]{Kud97} and \cite[(3-1)]{Liu}.  (See \eqref{zhx0}\eqref{zhx} for the   description in terms of the complex uniformization of ${\mathrm{Sh}}({\mathbb {V}})_K$.)
The proper pushforward defines a divisor  $Z(x)_K  $   on  ${\mathrm{Sh}}({\mathbb {V}})_K$ that is called a simple
special divisor.
%Let     $Z(x)=Z(x)_K $  for simplicity if the meaning is clear from the context.
The following observation is  trivial.
