# Topic[^1]

\begin{rmk}\label{MZZ} (1) This  lemma called almost modularity in \cite[Theorem 4.3]{MZ}. 

(2) In the case that $K=K_{\Lambda}$ with a different $\Lambda$, for Kudla-Rapoport arithmetic divisors and ${\mathcal {P}}\in  Z_1({\mathcal {X}}_K )_{\mathbb {C}}$ with  ${\mathcal {P}}_E=0$, the analogous statement  is   proved  in  \cite[Theorem 14.6]{ZZY}.
\end{rmk}
