# Topic[^1]


We define generating series of special  divisors on unitary Shimura varieties, and   several Green functions  for the  special  divisors.
Then we   propose two modularity problems using admissible cycles. 
A precise conjecture and    results on it are stated in \ref{Arithmetic modularity1}.
