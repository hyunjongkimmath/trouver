# Topic[^1]
\begin{lem} We have  $b_{v,t}=b_{v,1}+\log | t|_v$ and  $b_{v,1}$ is independent of $v$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}The lemma follows direct computations  with the following ingredients.
For the equation, use \eqref{translaw} and \eqref{Wtt}.
Note that the dependence on $v$ is on the weight ${\mathfrak{w}}_v$.
We use   \eqref{ktrivial}  and \eqref{wellknown} for $g\in K_v^{\max}$. 
\end{proof}
