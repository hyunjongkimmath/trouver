\begin{lem}\label{wr1}
(1) Assume $F\neq {\mathbb {Q}}$, or $F={\mathbb {Q}},n=1$ and  ${\mathbb {V}}^\infty$ is not split at some finite place.
Then  $E_0(0,g,\phi)= \omega ( g)\phi (0)$
and $C_0(0,g,\phi)(v)= c(g_v,\phi_v)\omega ( g^v)\phi^v (0)$ (where $v$ is a finite place). 

(2) In particular, assume that    $\phi_{{{v}}}$ is supported outside $V^\sharp(E_{v})$ for $v$ in a set $S$ of  two places   of $F$ and   
$g\in   P ({\mathbb {A}}_{F,S  })G({\mathbb {A}}_F^{S })$, then   $E_0(0,g,\phi)=0$ and $C_0(0,g,\phi)=0$.\end{lem}
\begin{proof}  (2) follows from (1) directly.  
Now we consider equation for  $E_0 (s,g,\phi)$ in (1).
If $F={\mathbb {Q}},n=1$ and  ${\mathbb {V}}^\infty$ is not split at some finite place,
it is proved in \cite[Proposition 2.9(3)]{YZZ}.
If
$F\neq {\mathbb {Q}}$ so that we have at least 2 infinite places, its proof is similar to the one in \cite[Proposition 2.9 (3)]{YZZ}
by using \eqref{E0} and \eqref{W00}.  (The Siegel-Weil formula \eqref{Ichthm} gives another proof.)
The proof of the equation for   $C_0(s,g,\phi)$ is similar, with the fact that ${\mathbb {V}}$ is not split at (at least) 2 places outside $v$ by the incoherence. See also \cite[p 53]{Yuan}.
\end{proof}
