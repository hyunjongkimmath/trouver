# Topic[^1]

We recall basic knowledge about  Eisenstein series and theta series. Then we set up basic properties of 
theta-Eisenstein series, i.e.  linear combinations of  products of  theta series and  Eisenstein series.   
Finally, we study  quasi-holomorphic projections and cuspidal holomorphic projections of theta-Eisenstein series. The original of theta-Eisenstein series is in \cite{GZ}.
We largely follow \cite{Yuan}\cite{YZ}\cite{YZZ}.
