# Topic[^1]
\begin{lem}\label{mylem1} 
  Assume that $v$ is a finite place and $\phi(0)=0$. Then  for $t$ small enough
  $W_{v,t} (s, g, \phi)=W_{v,0} (s, g, \phi)$ and is a holomorphic function. 
  \end{lem}
\begin{proof}The proof is by the reasoning as the proof of \cite[Lemma 4.2.4 (2)]{Qiu21}
  \end{proof}
