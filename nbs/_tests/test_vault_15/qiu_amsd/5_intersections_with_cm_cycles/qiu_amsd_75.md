 \label{Intersections with CM cycles}

We continue to use the notations  in the last section.   In particular,  $K_\Lambda$ is the stabilizer of a good lattice, ${\widetilde K_\Lambda}$ is 
the partially ordered set of compact open subgroups  $K\subset K_\Lambda$ which are principal congruence subgroups over  split places and the same with $K_\Lambda$ over nonsplit places,  and
   $\widetilde {\mathcal {X}}=\{{\mathcal {X}}_K\}_{K\in {{\widetilde K_\Lambda}}}$ is 
 the system of integral models of unitary Shimura varieties with  finite flat transition morphisms  $\pi_{K,K'}:{\mathcal {X}}_K\to {\mathcal {X}}_{K'}$. Moreover, we have the action  of $K_\Lambda$   on ${\mathcal {X}}_{K}$ through 
``right translation". We also defined arithmetic special divisors on them.

In this section,
we compare the generating series of arithmetic intersection numbers between  arithmetic special divisors  and    CM 1-cycles,    with   explicit automorphic forms.
The result is an arithmetic analogue of the mixed Siegel-Weil formula    \eqref{Ichthm1}. 
We use   this formula to prove the arithmetic modularity.
