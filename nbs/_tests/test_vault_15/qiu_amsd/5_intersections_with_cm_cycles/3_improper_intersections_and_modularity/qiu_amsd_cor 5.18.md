# Topic[^1]
\begin{cor}\label{entry30}% Let $\phi\in \overline {\mathcal {S}}\left( {\mathbb {V}}  \right)_{\overline{\mathbb {Q}}}^{K}$ be a pure tensor such that 
% $\phi_v=1_{\Lambda_v}$ for every finite place $v\not\in \{u_1,u_2\}$. 
For $t\in F_{>0}$  and     $g\in {\mathbb {G}}_{ \{u_1,u_2\}} $,  
\eqref{entryeqmod}      holds.
Equivalently,  \eqref{entry} holds.  \end{cor}
\begin{proof}  


We prove  \eqref{entryeqmod}.  By the projection formula, it is  easy to check that if \eqref{entry4} holds, then it holds after shrinking  $K$. By Corollary \ref{OOO} and Lemma \ref{OOOO},   we may assume that $\phi_{u_k}(0)=0$    for $k=1,2$. 
Such a $\phi_{u_1}$  can be written as a  sum of $E_{u_1} e_{u_1}^{(i)}$-regular functions $\phi_i$ for some $i$'s
and such a $\phi_{u_2}$  can be written as a  sum of $E_{u_2} e_{u_2}^{(j)}$-regular functions  $\psi_j$ for some $j$'s.
Since    \eqref{entryeqmod} is linear on $\phi_{u_1}\otimes\phi_{u_2}$, 
we may replace it $\phi_i\otimes \psi_j$. 
Recall that
${\mathbb {W}}_{u_1}^{(i,j)}=E_{u_1} e_{u_1}^{(i)}$    and    ${\mathbb {W}}_{u_2}^{(i,j)}=E_{u_2} e_{u_2}^{(j)}$.
Then  the corollary follows from   Lemma \ref{entry20}. 
\end{proof}
\begin{proof} [Proof of  \Cref{nctprop}] We have fixed and been using $ \phi_v'$, $v\in {\mathfrak{Ram}}$, after   \Cref{tech1}.  So  \eqref{entryc} holds.
Now we prove \eqref{entryeqmod}. 
     \Cref{entry30} already shows   \eqref{entryeqmod} for $g\in {\mathbb {G}}_{ \{u_1,u_2\}} $.
By Lemma \ref{wr} and   the Iwasawa decomposition,
\eqref{entryeqmod}  holds    for   $g\in  {\mathbb {G}}_{ \emptyset}$. 
%  When applying  Lemma \ref{wr},  we    choice a representative $k$ such that $k_{u_i}=1$ (which is allowed  since $K_{u_i}=K'_{u_i}$) so that it commutes  with $G(F_{u_i})$.  
\end{proof}
