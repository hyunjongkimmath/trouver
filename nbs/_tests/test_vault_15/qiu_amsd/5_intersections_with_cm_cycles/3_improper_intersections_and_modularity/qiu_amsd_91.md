\begin{rmk}\label{still apply}
Though  the two places $v_1,v_2$ do not appear in the statement of \Cref{tech2}, they will be needed to put
regularity assumptions for applying Proposition \ref{tech1} in an intermediate step  in the proof  of \Cref{tech2}. 
Later in  Lemma \ref{entry20}, we will use $u_1,u_2$ for  the regularity assumptions instead.   




\end{rmk}


  \subsubsection{Remove regularity 2: switch    CM cycles/regularity}
 % For $i,j=0,...,n$, let  ${{\mathbb {W}}^{(i,j)}}$      be as in \ref{CM cycle of  degree 0}.
