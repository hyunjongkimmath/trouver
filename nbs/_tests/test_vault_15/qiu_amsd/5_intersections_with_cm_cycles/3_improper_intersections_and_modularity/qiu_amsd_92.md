# Topic[^1]

\begin{rmk}    If $i=j=0$ (recall that ${\mathbb {W}}^{(0,0)}={\mathbb {W}}$),   Lemma \ref{entry20} is  equivalent to Proposition \ref{tech1} (2).
In general, we switch  from ${\mathbb {W}}_{u_k}^{(0,0)}$-regularity to ${\mathbb {W}}_{u_k}^{(i,j)}$-regularity.

   
   \end{rmk}

   
  
  
  %Let $u_1,u_2$, ${{\mathbb {W}}^{(i,j)}}$      be as in \ref{CM cycle of  degree 0}.
