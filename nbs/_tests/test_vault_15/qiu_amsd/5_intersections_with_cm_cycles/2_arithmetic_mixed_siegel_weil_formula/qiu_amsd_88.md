# Topic[^1]

\begin{rmk}(1)  
In this 
$(\mathrm{mod} \overline{\mathbb {Q}}\log S)$-version of Theorem \ref{nct}, we use $K'=K_S K_\Lambda^S$ rather than $K'=K_\Lambda$ as in Theorem \ref{nct}, i.e. we
do not ``pull back  the CM cycle over $S$".

(2)
We can allow $S$ to have more than 4 places, but not less, as we will see from its proof.
\end{rmk}
