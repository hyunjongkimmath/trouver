 Here we define $ f_{{\mathbb {W}},K'}$ for a general $K'$, rather than  $K'=K_\Lambda$, for later use.
\begin{rmk} 
Let us give a detailed  explanation of 
the right hand side of \eqref{fh}. 

(1) 
The index set and coefficients   are the ones in \eqref{PWK}.
Moreover, we    require $k_v=1$ if $K_v=K'_v$.
In particular, $\omega(k)(\phi^{v}\otimes\phi_v')=\left( \omega(k)\phi^{v}\right)\otimes\phi_v'$, which is precisely what we wrote $\omega(k)\phi^{v}\otimes\phi_v'$ for.


(2)  The  4 automorphic forms on the right hand side of \eqref{fh}
are  in ${\mathcal {A}}_{{\mathrm{hol}}}(G,{\mathfrak{w}})$.  They are independent of the choice of $k$. Indeed, the 4th
automorphic form $ {E\theta}  \lb0,g,\omega(k)\phi^{v}\otimes\phi_v'\right)
$ is independent of the choice of $k$, by the $K^v$-invariance of $\phi^v$ and the mixed   Siegel-Weil formula 
  \eqref{Ichthm1}. 
By \eqref{Final}, 
after taking the $\psi_t$-Whittaker functions, the first 3    automorphic forms  becomes 
$${E\theta}_{t,{\mathrm{qhol}}}'(0,g,\omega(k)\phi)-2\left( E'_{t,{\mathrm{f}}}(0,g,\omega(k)\phi) +E_t(0,g,\omega(k)\phi) \log {\mathrm{Nm}}_{F/{\mathbb {Q}}}t\right).$$ Then the independence of the choice of $k$  follows from \eqref{E0tk},
\eqref{E'0tk} and 
\eqref{Eqhol'0tk}.
    
  (3) Note that  we need the orthogonal decomposition ${\mathbb {V}}={\mathbb {W}}\oplus V^\sharp({\mathbb {A}}_F)$ to define  ${E\theta}'_{{\mathrm{chol}}}(\dots)$ and  $C(\dots)$,  and  the orthogonal decomposition $  W(v)\oplus V^\sharp$ to define $  {E\theta}  \left(\dots \right)$.

  
\end{rmk}

 

 
 \begin{rmk} 
 
   By  \Cref{gnm11}, Theorem \ref{nct} implies Theorem \ref{masw}.
And   as we have explained   below Theorem \ref{masw}, Theorem \ref{nct}  is an arithmetic analog of the mixed Siegel-Weil formula \eqref{Ichthm1}.
The arithmetic   mixed Siegel-Weil 
 formula  has its origin  in the celebrated work of Gross and Zagier \cite{GZ}, as mentioned in \ref{Motivation}. It also plays an important role in the work of   Yuan, S. Zhang and W. Zhang \cite{YZZ} generalizing the Gross-Zagier formula to quaternionic Shimura curves over general totally real fields. 
Compared with these  works, our formula   is more general in the following sense: 
Gross and Zagier \cite{GZ} only compared coefficients  co-prime to their Iwahori level; 
Yuan, S. Zhang and W. Zhang   \cite{YZZ} only  dealt with certain ``regular test functions", so that they only need to compute proper intersections  (while the main difficulty  of proving Theorem \ref{masw}
is to compute improper intersections as we will see). 





\end{rmk}
 \begin{rmk}\label{uselat}
  We use $\pi_{K,K'}^*{\mathcal {P}}_{{\mathbb {W}},K'} $ with $K'=K_{\Lambda}$, instead of the more natural CM cycle ${\mathcal {P}}_{{\mathbb {W}},K}$ (i.e. $K'=K$),  in order to apply  \Cref{pull1cor}
   to avoid computing  normalized admissible extensions. 
    (One may expect to reduce the whole \Cref{nct} to the    level  
    $K_\Lambda$ by the projection formula. However, this is not possible due to Remark \ref{notpush}.)


   %  Theorem \ref{nct} for a general $K'$ is clearly implied by Theorem \ref{nct} for $K'=K$. 
We can also consider Theorem \ref{nct} for $K'=K$.
 Taking advantage of Theorem \ref{main}, 
the only  difficulty  in proving Theorem \ref{nct} for $K'=K$ is  computing   normalized admissible extensions at split place. 
By  considering admissible 1-cycles, the difficulty could  be solved as in 
\cite[8.5.1]{YZZ}.  Note that we do not need Assumption 5.4 in loc. cit.. Rather we  will get an extra Eisenstein series.


\end{rmk}

%The advantage of \eqref{entry4} compared to  \eqref{entryeq}  is that both sides of  \eqref{entry4}  are (expected to be) Fourier coefficients so that we can apply a suitable   modularity argument.


\subsubsection{Strategy} \label{Strategy} 
We will need the following lemma.
