# Integral closure of Dedekind domain in finite separable field extension is Dedekind domain[^1]
Let $A$ be a [[marcus_dedekind_domain|Dedekind domain]] with fraction field $K$, let $L / K$ be a [[finite_field_extension|finite]] [[18785_Definition 4.3#Separable extension|separable extension]], and let $B$ be the integral closure of $A$ in $L$. 

Then $B$ is a Dedekind domain.

# Proof
Proof. Recall that we defined a Dedekind domain as an integrally closed noetherian domain of dimension at most one. Let us verify that each of these conditions holds:
- $B$ is an integrally closed domain (by definition);
- $B$ is finitely generated over the noetherian ring $A$ (by Prop. $5.21$ ), hence noetherian;
- $B$ has dimension at most 1, since $\operatorname{dim} B \leq \operatorname{dim} A \leq 1$, by Lemma $5.23 .$
Thus $B$ is a Dedekind domain.
