# Topic[^1]

This note contains a few notations: **$\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$**, **$\operatorname{Jac}(C)$**, **$L^1(X)$**.

Notation notes to two of these notations already exist, but these notation notes cover these notations "excessively" - $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ is covered by two notation notes and $\operatorname{Jac}(C)$ is covered by a single notation note twice. 

No notation notes for $L^1(X)$ exist.

The `make_notation_notes_from_double_asts` function applied to this note should create a new notation note for $L^1(X)$ and warn that there are notation notes for $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\operatorname{Jac}(C)$ covering these notations excessively.

Note that the already existing notation notes are not linked in the See Also section.
