This is some note in the text. It has some content.

There might be some paragraphs. Also a lot of math stuff.

A **group** is a set $G$ with a binary operator $\times: G \times G \to G$ satisfying the following:

1. (Associativity): $(g_1g_2)g_3 = g_1(g_2g_3)$ for all $g_1,g_2,g_3 \in G$.
2. (Identity): There is an element $1 \in G$ such that $1 \cdot g = g \cdot 1 = g$ for all $g \in G$.
3. (Inverse): For every $g \in G$, there is an element $g^{-1} \in G$ such that $g \cdot g^{-1} = g^{-1} g = 1$.

And I can even write some in-line LaTeX stuff:

$$\forall g \in G, |g| \mid |G|.$$

$$\langle g \rangle = \{g^n: n \in \mathbb{Z} \}.$$
