# Spectrum of a ring[^1]
Let $A$ be a ring.

The **Spectrum** **$\operatorname{Spec} A$** is the set of prime ideals of $A$. It is equipped with a topology, called the **Zariski topology** in which the followings sets, called the **distinguished open subsets of $\operatorname{Spec} A$**, give a base for the topology:

**$$D(f) = \{\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Spec} A: f \not\in \mathfrak{p} \}.$$**
