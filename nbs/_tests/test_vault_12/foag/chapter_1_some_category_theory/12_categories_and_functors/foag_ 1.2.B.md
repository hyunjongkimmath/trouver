# Automorphism group of an object in a category[^1]
1.2.B. EXERCISE. If $A$ is an object in a category $\mathscr{C}$, show that the invertible elements of $\operatorname{Mor}(A, A)$ form a group (called the **automorphism group of $A$**, denoted **$\operatorname{Aut} (A)) .$** What are the automorphism groups of the objects in Examples 1.2.2 and $1.2 .3 ?$ Show that two isomorphic objects have isomorphic automorphism groups. (For readers with a topological background: if $X$ is a topological space, then the fundamental groupoid is the category where the objects are points of $X$, and the morphisms $x \rightarrow y$ are paths from $x$ to $y$, up to homotopy. Then the automorphism group of $x_{0}$ is the (pointed) fundamental group $\pi_{1}\left(X, x_{0}\right) .$ In the case

where $X$ is connected, and $\pi_{1}(X)$ is not abelian, this illustrates the fact that for a connected groupoid - whose definition you can guess - the automorphism groups of the objects are all isomorphic, but not canonically isomorphic.)
