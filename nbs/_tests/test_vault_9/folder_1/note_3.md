This is another note, note_3.

This text is originally in note_3, but it shall be split into a new note.

This text is also originally in note_3, but it shall be split into yet another note.

This stuff will not be split into another note. It will stay will what's above it.

This text, however, will be split into another note. so note_3 splits into 4 notes, not counting the original.
