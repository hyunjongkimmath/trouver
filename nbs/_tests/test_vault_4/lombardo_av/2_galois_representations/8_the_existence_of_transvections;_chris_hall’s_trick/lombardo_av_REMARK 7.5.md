# Topic[^1]
REMARK 7.5. In fact, it is even true that $A(\mathbb{Q})_{\text {tors }} \rightarrow A\left(\mathbb{F}_{p}\right)$ is injective, provided that $p \geq 3$ is a prime of [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction of $A$.
8. The existence of transvections; Chris Hall's trick
[[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|Frobenius]] elements are very useful to control the image of Galois, but (due to the fundamental results of Faltings) they only provide [[18785_simple_ring|semisimple]] elements in Aut $\left(V_{\ell} A\right) .$ It is sometimes useful to have a source of unipotent elements to work with: in this direction a very useful trick was introduced by Chris Hall in [Hal11]. We state it in its simplest form:
