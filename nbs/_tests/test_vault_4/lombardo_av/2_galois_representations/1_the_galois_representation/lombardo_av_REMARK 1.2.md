# Galois representations are continuous[^1]
REMARK 1.2. The representations $\rho_{\ell^{n}}$[^2][^3]               are continuous: this amounts to saying that they factor through a [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] quotient of Gal $\bar{K} / K)$, and this is clear, because $\rho_{\ell^{n}}$[^2][^3]               becomes trivial upon extending the base field to $K\left(A\left[\ell^{n}\right]\right)$, the field obtained from $K$ by adjoining the coordinates of all the $\ell^{n}$ torsion points. Notice that - since there are only finitely many
1 in all our applications, $\ell$ will be different from the characteristic of $K$

2. GALOIS REPRESENTATIONS
torsion points and each of them has algebraic coordinates $-$ the field $K\left(A\left[\ell^{n}\right]\right)$ is a [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] extension of $K$.
