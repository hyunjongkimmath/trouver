THEOREM 8.1. Let $A / K$ be an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] with [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.3|NÃ©ron model]] $\mathcal{A}$. Suppose there exists a [[place_of_a_global_field#Place of a global field 1|place]] $v$ of $K$ at which $A$ has [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.4|semistable]] reduction of toric rank 1 (see definition 4.6). Let $\ell$ be a prime which does not divide the Tamagawa numberf of $A$ at $v$. Then G $_{\ell \infty}$ contains a transvection, that is, an automorphism $M$ such that the image of $M-I$ is a saturated $^{7} \mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$-module of $\operatorname{rank} 1$.
9. Raynaud's theorem: the action of the inertia at $\ell$
As we have seen, [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|Frobenius]] polynomials capture essentially all the information concerning our Galois representations when we restrict to the [[18785_Definition 7.6#Decomposition group 1|decomposition group]] of a [[place_of_a_global_field#Place of a global field 1|place]] at which the representation is [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.1_page_47|unramified]]. Even when the underlying [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] has [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction everywhere, however, this is not the full story, because of the action of the inertia at primes of characteristic $\ell$. This is a very rich subject (and the starting point of $p$-adic Hodge theory), so we content ourselves with describing a single (very useful) result due to Raynaud Ray74 :
