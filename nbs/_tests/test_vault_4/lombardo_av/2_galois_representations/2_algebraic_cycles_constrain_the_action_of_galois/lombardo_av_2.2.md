# Topic[^1]
2.2. Endomorphisms. By the same reasoning as in remark 2.4, one sees that the existence of nontrivial $K$-endomorphisms of $A$ automatically leads to restrictions for the image of Galois: indeed, if $\varphi: A \rightarrow A$ is an [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.9|endomorphism]] of $A$ defined over $K$, for any torsion point $P \in A\left[\ell^{n}\right]$ and for every $\sigma \in \operatorname{Gal}(\bar{K} / K)$ we have
$$
\sigma(\varphi(P))=\varphi(\sigma(P))
$$
an equality which should be interpreted as saying that the knowledge of the action of $\sigma(P)$ is enough to determine the action of $\sigma$ on $\varphi(P) .$ Clearly this is (in general) a nontrivial restriction on the possible automorphisms of $T_{\ell}(A)$[^2]               which can lie in the image of Galois.
