# Tate's theorem is an analogue to analytic uniformization[^1]
REMARK 2.12. This is an incredibly powerful result: it reduces the problem of studying maps between [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] (which might seem to be highly non-linear objects) to that of understanding certain linear objects. It is not unreasonable to consider [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 2.10|this theorem]] as a sophisticated version of [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 4.1|analytic uniformisation]]: over $\mathbb{C}$ we have a vector space, namely $H_{1}(A(\mathbb{C}), \mathbb{C})$, containing a [[18785_Definition 5.9|lattice]], namely $H_{1}(A(\mathbb{C}), \mathbb{Z})$, and maps between [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] can be described as linear maps between $\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces that behave in a certain way with respect to the respective lattices. Here the [[18785_Definition 5.9|lattice]] $H_{1}(A(\mathbb{C}), \mathbb{Z})$ is replaced by the $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$-[[18785_Definition 5.9|lattice]] $T_{\ell}(A)$[^2]              , the ambient vector space by $V_{\ell}(A)$[^3][^4]              , and the action of Galois ensures that the maps in question are defined over the correct ground field.

When $K$ is a [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] field, Gal $(\bar{K} / K)$ is (pro)cyclic, generated by [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|Frobenius]], so the Galois action on $\left.V_{\ell}(A), V_{\ell}(B)\right)$[^3][^4]               is completely determined from the characteristic polynomial of [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|Frobenius]] (see definition 5.5). This leads to the following
