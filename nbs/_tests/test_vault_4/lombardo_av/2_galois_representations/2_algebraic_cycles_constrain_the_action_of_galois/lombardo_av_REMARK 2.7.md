# Topic[^1]
REMARK 2.7. This discussion applies in particular to the endomorphisms $[n]$[^2]               of $A$, but all that can be deduced from the existence of these endomorphisms is the fact that $\sigma$ acts $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$-linearly on $T_{\ell}(A)$[^3]              ; this fact is already subsumed by our very notation, since we are considering the image of Galois as a subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}\left(T_{\ell}(A)\right)$[^3]
