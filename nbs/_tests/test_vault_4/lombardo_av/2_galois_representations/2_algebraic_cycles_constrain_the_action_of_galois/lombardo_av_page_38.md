# Topic[^1]
2. Algebraic cycles constrain the action of Galois
A guiding principle in the study of [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.1_page_37|Galois representation]] is that
if the image of Galois is small, there must be a [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reason!
We now try to explain what this principle means in practice. Recall that an algebraic cycle is, roughly speaking, a formal linear combination of ([[foag_irreducible_topological_space|irreducible]] [[foag_reduced_scheme|reduced]] closed) subvarieties.
