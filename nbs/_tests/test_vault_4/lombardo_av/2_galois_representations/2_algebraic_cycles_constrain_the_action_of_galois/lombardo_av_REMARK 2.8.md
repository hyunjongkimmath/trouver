# Topic[^1]
REMARK 2.8. As in remark 2.4, the restrictions on the image of Galois coming from the existence of nontrivial endomorphisms can be interpreted as the existence of suitable algebraic cycles, namely the graph of the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.9|endomorphism]] itself in $A \times A$.

## 
A special case is that of decomposable [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]]: if $A$ is isomorphic to $B \times C$, then $T_{\ell}(A)$[^2]               decomposes as $T_{\ell}(B) \oplus T_{\ell}(C)$, and the image of Galois will $-$ in a suitable basis - act through block-diagonal matrices. If $A$ is only [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.13|isogenous]] to a product $B \times C$ the same is true after tensoring with Q\ell: more precisely, while it is not true in general that $T_{\ell}(A) \cong T_{\ell}(B) \oplus T_{\ell}(C)$[^2]              , it is true that $V_{\ell}(A) \triangleq V_{\ell}(B) \oplus V_{\ell}(C)$[^3][^4]               (recall that $V_{\ell}(A)$[^3][^4]               is the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 10.10#Rational Tate module of an abelian variety|rational Tate module]] $T_{\ell}(A) \otimes_{\ell \ell}$[^2]               Q\ell $)$; this means that the action of Galois may be put in block-diagonal form after a change of basis that may involve denominators.
