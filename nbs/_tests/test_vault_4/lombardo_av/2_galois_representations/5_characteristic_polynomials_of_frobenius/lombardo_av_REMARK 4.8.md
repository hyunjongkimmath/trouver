# Topic[^1]
REMARK 4.8. When working with elliptic curves one often uses the term multiplicative reduction to refer to what we're calling [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.4|semistable]] reduction. In higher dimensions, however, the distinction is important.

The reader familiar with elliptic curves might also want to think about the following possible definition of multiplicative reduction: an elliptic [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] has multiplicative reduction at $v$ if and only if the group of the [[foag_smoothness_over_a_field|smooth]] points in the reduction is isomorphic (possibly after a quadratic extension) to $\mathbb{G}_{m} .$
