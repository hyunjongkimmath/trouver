THEOREM 4.13. Let $A / K$ be an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]]; we consider the reduction properties of $A$ either over $R$ (if $K=\operatorname{Frac}(R)$ is local) or at a fixed [[place_of_a_global_field#Place of a global field 1|place]] of $K$ (if $K$ is a [[number_field|number field]]).
(1) Suppose that A has [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction. Then A has [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.4|semistable]] reduction.
(2) Suppose that A has [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction. Then for any field extension L/K the [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] $A_{L}$ also has [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction (at all the places of $L$ above $v$, when $K$ is a [[number_field|number field]])
(3) Suppose that A has bad [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.4|semistable]] reduction. Then for any field extension L/K the [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] $A_{L}$ has bad [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.4|semistable]] reduction (at all the places of $L$ above $v$, when $K$ is a [[number_field|number field]])

We finish this paragraph by giving some useful information on the reduction [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.10|type]] of a [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]]:
