THEOREM 4.10 (Finiteness of the set of [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|places of bad reduction]]). Let $A / K$ be an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] over a [[number_field|number field]]. Then A has [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction at all but finitely many places of $K$

PRoOF. Follows from the general principle known as spreading out. More specifically, since $A \rightarrow \operatorname{Spec}(K)$ is defined over the [[generic_point_of_a_closed_subset|generic point]] of $\operatorname{Spec}\left(\mathcal{O}_{K}\right)$[^2]              , it can be extended (as a variety, not necessarily as an [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 2.1|abelian scheme]]) to some open subset of $\mathrm{Spec}\left(\mathcal{O}_{K}\right) .$[^2]               The same4. THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE SEMISTABLE (REDUCTION)

holds for the multiplication, inverse, and unit maps; since the intersection of open subsets is open, this implies that we can find a common open subscheme $S$ of $\operatorname{Spec}\left(\mathcal{O}_{K}\right)$[^2]               over which $A, m, i$, and the unit section all extend. Given that the maps satisfy the commutative diagrams that encode the property of being a group generically, they also satisfy the same properties over $S$ : this means precisely that there is an [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 2.1|abelian scheme]] $\mathcal{A} \rightarrow S$ with generic fibre $A$. The [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|places of bad reduction]] of $A$ are then contained in the [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] set $\operatorname{Spec}\left(\mathcal{O}_{K}\right) \backslash S .$[^2]              
In layman's terms, the argument is simply the following: choose any set of equations for $A$ and for the morphisms that give $A$ its group structure. Let $T$ be the set of primes of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$[^2]               that divide the denominator of at least one coefficient of at least one equation of the given presentation (there are only finitely many of them); on $\operatorname{Spec}\left(\mathcal{O}_{K}\right) \backslash T$[^2]               the given equations already define an [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 2.1|abelian scheme]].
