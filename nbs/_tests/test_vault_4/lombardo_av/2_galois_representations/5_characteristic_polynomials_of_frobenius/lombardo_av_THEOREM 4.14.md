# Topic[^1]
THEOREM 4.14 (Bad reduction of a [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]]). Let $C / K$ be a [[foag_smoothness_over_a_field|smooth]] [[foag_projective_scheme_over_a_ring#Projective scheme over a ring 1|projective]] [[foag_geometric_point#Geometric properties|geometrically]] [[foag_irreducible_topological_space|irreducible]] [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] of genus $g \geq 2$. The [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] $J$ of $C$, considered as an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] over $K$, has [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction at $v$ whenever $C$ does $^{3}$ (but the converse implication does not hold: it is possible for $J$ to have [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction at $v$ even when $C$ has bad reduction there). Moreover, $J$ has [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.4|semistable]] reduction at $v$ whenever $C$ admits a [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.4|semistable]] model over $\mathcal{O}_{K, v}$[^2][^3]              , that is, there is a model $\mathcal{C}$ over $\mathcal{O}_{K, v}$[^2][^3]               whose special fiber has only [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.11|ordinary]] double points as singularities.
3 in the obvious sense: $C$ extends to a [[foag_smoothness_over_a_field|smooth]] [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] over $\operatorname{Spec}\left(\mathcal{O}_{K, v}\right)$[^2][^3]              46
2. GALOIS REPRESENTATIONS
potentially [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.4|semistable]] implies [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] it

We also have the following theorem, which is very useful when working with Jacobians:
