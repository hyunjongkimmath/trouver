# Abelian variety acquiring good/semistable reduction after a base change[^1]
Let $L / K$ be a finite extension of fields. 

We say that $A$ **acquires good reduction over** $L$ (respectively acquires **semistable reduction** over $L$) at $v$ if $A \times_{K} L$ has [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] (respectively [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.4|semistable]]) reduction at all places of $\mathcal{O}_{L}$ lying above $v$

# Potentially good/semistable reduction
Finally, we say that $A$ has **potentially good** (respectively **potentially semistable**) reduction at $v$ if there exists some extension $L / K$ such that $A$ acquires good (semistable) reduction at $v$ over $L$.
