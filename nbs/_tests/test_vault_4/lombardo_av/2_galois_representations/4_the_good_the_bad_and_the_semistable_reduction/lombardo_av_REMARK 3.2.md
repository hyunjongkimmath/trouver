# Topic[^1]
REMARK 3.2. Even though the full conjecture remains open, various parts of it (and several special cases) have been proven: there is a precise description of the group MT $(A)$ (which does indeed depend only on $A(\mathbb{C})$, and which by work of Deligne does not depend on the embedding of $K$ in $\mathbb{C}$ ); part $(2 \mathrm{a})$ has also been proven by Deligne, and for part (2b) one does at least know that $\rho_{\ell^{\infty}}\left(\mathrm{Gal}\left(\overline{K^{\prime}} / K^{\prime}\right)\right)$[^2][^3]               is open (in the $\ell$-adic topology) in its Zariski closure. What we don't know is whether this Zariski closure is all of MT $(A)\left(\mathbb{Q}_{\ell}\right) !$
