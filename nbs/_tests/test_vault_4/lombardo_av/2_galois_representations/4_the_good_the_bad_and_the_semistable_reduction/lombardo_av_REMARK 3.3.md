# Topic[^1]
REMARK 3.3. The Mumford-Tate conjecture gives a precise meaning to the following vague intuitions:4. THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE SEMISTABLE (REDUCTION)
43
(1) independence of $\ell$ : indeed, it says that the different $G_{\ell^{\infty}}$[^2]               are all interpolated by a single Q-[[lombardo_av_REMARK 1.3|algebraic group]]
(2) the image of Galois is as large as it can be, once the obvious restrictions have been taken into account: loosely speaking, all the restrictions on $G_{\ell^{\infty}}$[^2]               should come from algebraic cycles, and $\mathrm{MT}(A)$ is defined so as to capture the existence of all algebraic cycles. Therefore part $(2 \mathrm{~b})$ of the conjecture says that the image of Galois is - up to some [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] index - as large as it can be, given the geometric restrictions encoded by $\mathrm{MT}(A)$.
4. The Good, the Bad, and the Semistable (reduction)
This is a technical section, which will be needed in the following when we'll need to work with [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|Frobenius]] elements and their characteristic polynomials.
