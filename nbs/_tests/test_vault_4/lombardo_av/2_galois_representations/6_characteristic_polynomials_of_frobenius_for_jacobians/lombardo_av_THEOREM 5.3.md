Let $A / K$ be an [[abelian_variety|abelian variety]] (over a [[number_field|number field]]),

For every $\ell$ and $n$, the representations $\rho_{\ell^n}$[^2] and $\rho_{\ell^\infty}$[^3] attached to $A$ are [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.1_page_47|unramified]] away from $\ell$ and from the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|places of bad reduction]] of $A$.

This result is a consequence of the smooth proper base change theorem in Ã©tale cohomology, so we omit its proof. The statement itself, however, is really quite crucial in many applications!

#_meta/TODO/link smooth proper base change theorem

The property of being unramified is extremely important. It leads in particular [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|to the following definition]]:
