# Topic[^1]
EXERCISE 1.12. Play the following game with a partner. Ask them to query the LMFDB for genus 2 curves with Sato-Tate group $G_{3,3}$ and with $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-[[18785_simple_ring|simple]] [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] $^{1}$. They choose such a [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $C$ and tell you the equation; you need to guess the algebra End $_{Q}^{0}(\operatorname{Jac}(C)) .$ You are only allowed to compute characteristic polynomials of [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|Frobenius]] - but of course you may use your favourite computer algebra system.
