EXERCISE 1.9. Let $C$ be the [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] given by $y^{2}=f(x)$ (with $f(x)$ separable of [[degree_of_an_algebraic_field_extension|degree]] $5)$, and let $\infty$ be the point at infinity of $C .$ Embed $C$ into its [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] $J$ via $P \mapsto[P-\infty]$. Let $\iota$ be the involution $\iota(x, y)=(x,-y)$ of $C$; as we have seen (proposition 9.22 ), $\iota$ induces an automorphism of $J$. Prove that this automorphism is multiplication by $-1$.
