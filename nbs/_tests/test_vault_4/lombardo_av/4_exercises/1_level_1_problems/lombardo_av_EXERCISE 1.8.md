# Topic[^1]
EXERCISE 1.8. Let $C / K$ be the hyperelliptic curve $y^{2}=f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a separable monic polynomial of degree 5 and $K$ is a field not of characteristic $2 .$ Describe a $\mathbb{F}_{2}$-basis for the $\mathbb{F}_{2}$-vector space $\operatorname{Jac}(C)[2](\bar{K})$. How does the answer change if $f(x)$ is not monic? How does it change if it has degree $6 ?$
Hint. See exercise $[2,3]$
