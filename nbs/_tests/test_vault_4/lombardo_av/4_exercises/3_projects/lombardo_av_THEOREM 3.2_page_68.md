THEOREM 3.2 (Zarhin). Let $f(x)$ be a separable polynomial of [[degree_of_an_algebraic_field_extension|degree]] $n \geq 5$ with coefficients in a [[number_field|number field]] $K .$ Let $C$ be the [[foag_hyperelliptic_curve|hyperelliptic]] [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $y^{2}=f(x)$, and suppose that the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $K$ is either $A_{n}$ or $S_{n}$. Then for the [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] $J$ of $C$ we have $\operatorname{End}_{K}(J)=\mathbb{Z}$

The aim of this project is to find similar criteria which give information on $\operatorname{End}_{K}(J)$ (or $\left.\operatorname{End}_{K}(J)\right)$ in terms of properties of the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ : here are two possible extensions for you to think about.
(1) are there assumptions on $G$ (weaker than $G$ containing $A_{n}$, of course) that ensure that $J$ is [[foag_geometric_point#Geometric properties|geometrically]] [[foag_irreducible_topological_space|irreducible]]?
(2) fix a (small) value of $g$ and a [[foag_proper_morphism_of_schemes|proper]] subgroup $H$ of $A_{n} .$ Is there a polynomial $f_{H}(x)$ of [[degree_of_an_algebraic_field_extension|degree]] $n$ with Galois group $H$ and such that the [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] $J_{H}$ of $y^{2}=f_{H}(x)$ has ([[foag_geometric_point#Geometric properties|geometrically]]) nontrivial [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.9|endomorphism]] ring? If the answer is yes, then you have found an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] with an 'interesting' [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.1_page_37|Galois representation]] (nontrivial endomorphisms and prescribed structure on $J_{H}[2]$ ). If the answer is no, you have found a strengthening of Zarhin's theorem.
