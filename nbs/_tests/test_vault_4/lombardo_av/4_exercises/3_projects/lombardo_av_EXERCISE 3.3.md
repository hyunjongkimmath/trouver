EXERCISE 3.3 (small torsion of non-[[foag_hyperelliptic_curve|hyperelliptic]] Jacobians). The purpose of this exercise is to investigate the geometry of torsion points of small order on Jacobians of nonhyperelliptic curves.
(1) Let $C$ be a genus- 3 non [[foag_hyperelliptic_curve|hyperelliptic]] [[foag_11.1.3|curve]], presented as a [[foag_smoothness_over_a_field|smooth]] plane quartic $F(X, Y, Z)=0 .$ Can you describe the 2 -torsion in $J=\operatorname{Jac}(C)$ in terms of the geometry of $F ?$ [This is known, but I'm not sure where to find it in the literature].3.

(2) Can you find a similar geometric description for a non-[[foag_hyperelliptic_curve|hyperelliptic]] genus 4 [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] presented as the intersection of a quadric and a cubic in $\mathbb{P}^{3} ?$ [I haven't tried to solve this exercise].
(3) Can you find further interesting classes of curves $C$ for which some of the groups $\operatorname{Jac}(C)[\ell]$ are easy to describe in geometric terms?
