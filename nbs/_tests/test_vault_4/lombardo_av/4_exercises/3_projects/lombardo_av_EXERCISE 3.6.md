# Topic[^1]
EXERCISE 3.6 (Prime values of some quadratic polynomials). Consider the elliptic [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $E: y^{2}=x^{3}+x$ over the field $Q .$ Let $p \equiv 1(\bmod 4)$ be a prime number; it is well-known that $p$ can be written as $p=a^{2}+b^{2}$ in an essentially unique $^{2}$ way.
(1) Compute the trace of the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|Frobenius]] at $p$ in terms of $a$ and $b$.
(2) Notice that whenever the trace of the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|Frobenius]] at $p$ is $\pm 2$ the prime number $p$ is of the form $x^{2}+1$ (and recall that it is not known whether there exist infinitely many primes of this form).
(3) Google the Lang-Trotter conjecture (a [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reference for the purposes of this project is [BJ09]). Combined with the previous remarks, what does the LangTrotter conjecture imply on the distribution of primes $p$ of the form $x^{2}+1 ?$
(4) Can you derive the same prediction from analytic number theory, without resorting to the theory of elliptic curves?
(5) Apply the same argument to other CM elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. What are the corresponding predictions about the prime values taken by certain quadratic polynomials?
(6) Can you support these predictions by analytic arguments and/or with numerical experiments?
(7) $(\star)$ Can you find a higher-dimensional analogue of these heuristics? (That is, can you make similar predictions by looking at CM [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] of dimension 2 or more?)
${ }^{2}$ that is, up to exchanging $a$ and $b$ and to a choice of signs
