EXERCISE 2.6. Consider the [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $X_{1}(13): y^{2}+\left(x^{3}+x+1\right) y=x^{5}+x^{4}$. Using information from the $\mathrm{LMFDB}$ if necessary, determine the size of the image of the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.1_page_37|Galois representation]] $\rho_{19}$ attached to the [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] of $X_{1}(13)$. Can you also determine the image of $\rho_{19}$ up to conjugacy?

Hint. This is a hard exercise; here is one way of doing it (which assumes all the information from the LMFDB):
(1) show that the order of $G_{19}$ divides $6 \cdot 19 \cdot 18$
(2) prove that $\# G_{19}$ is divisible by $6 \cdot 18$
(3) observe that if $19 \nmid \# G_{19}$, then all the 19-torsion of $J$ is defined over $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_{13}, \zeta_{19}\right)$
(4) use information coming from the reduction of $J$ at $p=1483$ to decide whether or not $19 \mid \# G_{19}$.
Note. This is a famous [[foag_11.1.3|curve]]! Knowing the structure of $J(\mathbb{Q})_{\text {tors }}[19]$ allowed Tate and Mazur [MT74] to prove that there are no elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ admitting a rational 13-torsion point.
