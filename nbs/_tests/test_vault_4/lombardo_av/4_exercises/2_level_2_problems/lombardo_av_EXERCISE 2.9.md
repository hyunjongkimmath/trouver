# Topic[^1]
EXERCISE 2.9. Let $C / \mathbb{Q}$ be a genus 2 [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] with [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction away from $2 .$
(1) Prove that $J=\operatorname{Jac}(C)$ admits a rational 2 -torsion point.
(2) What is the minimal order of $J(\mathbb{Q})$ tors for such a [[foag_11.1.3|curve]]?
Hint. It might be possible to solve this problem without the help of a computer, but https://hobbes. la.asu.edu/NFDB/ will probably come in handy.
