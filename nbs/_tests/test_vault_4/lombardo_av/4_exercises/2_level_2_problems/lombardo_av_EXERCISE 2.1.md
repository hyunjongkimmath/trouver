EXERCISE 2.1 (B. Poonen). If $A$ is a $g$-dimensional [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 6.6|principally polarised]] [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] over $K$ with End $_{K}(A)=\mathbb{Z}$, and $G$ is a [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] subgroup of $A$ whose order $n$ is not a $g$-th power, then $B:=A / G$ is an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] that admits no principal [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.8|polarization]]. Show that the assumption on End $_{K}(A)$ is necessary.
${ }^{1}$ these conditions are equivalent to the geometric [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.9|endomorphism]] algebra of the [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] being a real quadratic field and to all the endomorphisms being defined over $\mathbb{Q}$2. LEVEL 2 PROBLEMS
