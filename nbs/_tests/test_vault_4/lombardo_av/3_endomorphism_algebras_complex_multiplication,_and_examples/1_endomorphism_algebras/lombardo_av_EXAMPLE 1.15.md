3. ENDOMORPHISM ALGEBRAS, COMPLEX MULTIPLICATION, AND EXAMPLES
where $f(x)$ is a separable polynomial of [[degree_of_an_algebraic_field_extension|degree]] 4 . Then there is an action of $\zeta_{3}$ on $C$, and therefore also on $J=\operatorname{Jac}(C) .$ Assume that $J$ is [[foag_geometric_point#Geometric properties|geometrically]] [[foag_irreducible_topological_space|irreducible]]: what can its geometric [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.9|endomorphism]] algebra look like? It's certainly not [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.10|type]] II or III in the Albert classification, because these only arise for even $g$. It's not an algebra of [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.10|type]] I either, because the field $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_{3}\right)$ cannot be embedded in a totally real [[number_field|number field]]. So it is of [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.10|type]] IV, and since $g=3$ we must have $d=1$ and $e_{0} \in\{1,3\} .$[^2]               Hence the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.9|endomorphism]] algebra of $J$ is a [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 2.1_page_60|CM field]]: more precisely, it is either quadratic imaginary (in which case it is $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_{3}\right):$ this is the general case), or a sextic [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 2.1_page_60|CM field]] given by the compositum of $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_{3}\right)$ with a totally real cubic field.
