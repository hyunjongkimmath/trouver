# Topic[^1]
EXAMPLE 1.17 (A [[18785_simple_ring|simple]], not [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.18#Geometrically simple abelian variety|absolutely simple]] abelian surface). Consider the [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] $J$ of the [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $C: y^{2}=x^{5}-3 x^{4}+3 x^{2}+x(\mathrm{LMFDB}) .$ A quick computation reveals that2. COMPLEX MULTIPLICATION

the characteristic polynomial of the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|Frobenius]] at 7 is $t^{4}-10 t^{2}+49$, which is [[foag_irreducible_topological_space|irreducible]] over Q; this immediately implies that $J$ is $\mathbb{F}_{7}$-[[foag_irreducible_topological_space|irreducible]], hence also Q-[[foag_irreducible_topological_space|irreducible]]. However, we notice that $\operatorname{Aut}_{\mathbb{Q}(i)}(C)$ contains $\alpha:(x, y) \mapsto\left(\frac{-1}{x}, \frac{i y}{x^{3}}\right)$, which induces an automorphism $\alpha$ on $J .$ Notice that $\alpha \neq-$ id on $J$ since $-$ id is induced by the [[foag_hyperelliptic_curve|hyperelliptic]] involution (exercise $1.9 \mathrm{f}$ ), so $\beta_{1}:=\alpha-\mathrm{Id}$ and $\beta_{2}:=\alpha+\mathrm{Id}$ are both nontrivial endomorphisms. Since their product is zero (but neither is trivial), one sees immediately that $\beta_{1}, \beta_{2}$ have kernels of positive dimension. The identity components $E_{1}, E_{2}$ of these kernels are abelian subvarieties of $J$, which is therefore not [[18785_simple_ring|simple]]: since $J$ is a surface, $E_{1}, E_{2}$ are forced to be of dimension 1 (hence elliptic curves), which proves that $J_{Q(i)} \sim E_{1} \times E_{2}$[^2][^3]              .
