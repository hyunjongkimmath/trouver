1.1. Behaviour under reduction, ordinarity. We quickly discuss the relationship between the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.9|endomorphism]] algebra of an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] over a [[number_field|number field]] $K$ and that of any of its reductions. The crucial fact is the following:

THEOREM $1.10([\mathbb{S T} 61$, Proposition $6.1]) .$ Let $A$ be an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] over a [[number_field|number field]] $K$ and let $v$ be a [[place_of_a_global_field#Place of a global field 1|place]] of [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction for $A$. The natural map
$$
\operatorname{End}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q} \rightarrow \operatorname{End}\left(A_{v}\right) \otimes \mathbb{Q}
$$
is injective.1. ENDOMORPHISM ALGEBRAS

It is also interesting to understand how the endomorphisms of an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] over a [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] field change upon extension of the ground field. We shall need a definition:
