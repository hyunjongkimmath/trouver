THEOREM 10.1 (Isogeny theorem). There is an (explicit) function $f(g, d, h)$ with the following property. For every [[number_field|number field]] $K$ of [[degree_of_an_algebraic_field_extension|degree]] at most $d$ and for every pair of g-dimensional [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] $A / K, B / K$ such that there exists a $K$-[[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.3|isogeny]] between $A$ and $B$, there exists $a K-$ [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.3|isogeny]] $\psi: A \rightarrow B$ of [[degree_of_an_algebraic_field_extension|degree]] bounded by $f(g, d, h(A))$, where $h(A)$ is the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.4|semistable]] Faltings height of $A^{\otimes}$
$8_{\text {we shall not define this notion here; we only remark that } h(A) \text { is a measure of the arithmetic com- }}$ plexity of $A$, and in the case of an elliptic [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $E$ it agrees (up to bounded error) with $\frac{1}{12} h(j(E))$, where $j(E)$ is the usual $j$-invariant and $h$ denotes the logarithmic Weil heightCHAPTER 3
Endomorphism algebras, [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.9|complex multiplication]], and examples
1. Endomorphism algebras
The purpose of this section is to recall the following theorem of Albert, which is often very helpful to determine the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.9|endomorphism]] algebra of an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]]:
