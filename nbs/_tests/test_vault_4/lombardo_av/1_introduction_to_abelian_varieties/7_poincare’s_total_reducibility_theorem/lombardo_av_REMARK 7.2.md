REMARK 7.2. The [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.3|isogeny]] in Poincar√©'s theorem is usually not an isomorphism. When $n=2$ (i.e. there are two [[18785_simple_ring|simple]] subvarieties $A_{1}, A_{2}$ of $A$ such that the sum $+: A_{1} \times A_{2} \rightarrow A$ is an [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.3|isogeny]]), the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.1|kernel]] of the sum is essentially the intersection $A_{1} \cap A_{2} \cdot$
8. The Mordell-Weil theorem
Even though we won't make much use of this theorem, no introduction to the arithmetic theory of [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] would be [[foag_proper_morphism_of_schemes#Complete k -scheme|complete]] without a mention of the famous Mordell-Weil theorem:
