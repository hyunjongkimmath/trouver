1. In the definition, one may replace [[foag_projective_scheme_over_a_ring#Projective scheme over a ring 1|projective]] with [[foag_proper_morphism_of_schemes|proper]]. It is a theorem of Weil that the two definitions are equivalent: a [[foag_reduced_scheme|reduced]], [[connected_topological_space|connected]], [[foag_proper_morphism_of_schemes|proper]] [[lombardo_av_REMARK 1.3|algebraic group]] is automatically [[foag_projective_scheme_over_a_ring#Projective scheme over a ring 1|projective]] (for a proof see $[\mathrm{Mil12}, \delta 7]) .$
2. Since [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] by definition are [[connected_topological_space|connected]] and possess a $K$-rational point, they are also [[foag_geometric_point#Geometric properties|geometrically]] [[connected_topological_space|connected]] Sta18, Tag 04KV.
3. A theorem of Cartier shows that if $\operatorname{char} (K)=0$ all [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.1|group schemes]] over $K$ are automatically [[foag_reduced_scheme|reduced]] ([EMvG, Theorem 3.20]); this is not true in general over fields of positive characteristic.
4. It is a well-known fact ([EMvG, Proposition 3.17]) that all [[foag_reduced_scheme|reduced]] [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.1|group schemes]] over a field are [[foag_smoothness_over_a_field|smooth]]. Combined with the previous [[lombardo_av_REMARK 1.4]|remarks]], this shows that if $\operatorname{char}(K)=0$ one may simply define [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] as [[connected_topological_space|connected]], [[foag_proper_morphism_of_schemes|proper]] [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.1|group schemes]] over $K$

Since we are all familiar with the notion of on abelian group, it would be quite disconcerting if [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] (or rather, the groups consisting of their rational points) were not commutative. Luckily, the nomenclature is consistent:
