# Elliptic curves are [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]][^1]
1. Elliptic curves are [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]]. In fact, the term elliptic [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] is synonymous with [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] of dimension 1. Recall that an elliptic [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] is a nice genus 1 [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] with a marked rational point: the rational point is essential in defining the group law (in fact, Proposition 1.9 implies in particular that the group law is uniquely determined by the choice of the neutral element).
2. Let $E_{1}, \ldots, E_{g}$ be elliptic curves: then $E_{1} \times \cdots \times E_{g}$ is a [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.1|group scheme]] which is [[connected_topological_space|connected]], [[foag_smoothness_over_a_field|smooth]] and [[foag_projective_scheme_over_a_ring#Projective scheme over a ring 1|projective]], hence an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] (of dimension $g$ ). Onet can prove that not all $g$-dimensional [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] are of this form: in what follows we shall see (many) examples of [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] that are not products of elliptic curves.
