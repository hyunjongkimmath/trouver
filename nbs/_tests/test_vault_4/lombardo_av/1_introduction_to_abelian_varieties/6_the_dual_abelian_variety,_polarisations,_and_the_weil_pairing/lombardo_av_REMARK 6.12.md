REMARK 6.12. Cartier duality over fields of positive characteristic can be quite complicated. Over fields of characteristic zero, however, the Cartier [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.7|dual]] is easy to describe: if $G$ is a [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] commutative group of order $N$,
$$
G^{\vee}=\operatorname{Hom}\left(G(\bar{K}), \mu_{N}(\bar{K})\right)
$$
More precisely: a [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.1|group scheme]] $G^{\vee}$ is described by a [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] abstract group $H$, together with an action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{K} / K)$ on $H$. In this case the underlying [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] group $H$ is $\operatorname{Hom}\left(G(\bar{K}), \mu_{N}(\bar{K})\right)$, and the Galois action is the natural one.6.
