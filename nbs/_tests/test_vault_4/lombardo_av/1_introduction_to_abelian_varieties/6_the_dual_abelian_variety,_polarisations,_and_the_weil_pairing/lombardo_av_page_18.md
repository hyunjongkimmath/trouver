# Topic[^1]
We now introduce the dual abelian variety of an abelian variety $A$. The reader familiar with elliptic curves may never have heard of the notion, because for an elliptic curve $E$ the dual abelian variety is $E$ itself, and the distinction is almost never made. With varieties of higher dimension, however, $A$ and its dual are often not isomorphic and it becomes important to distinguish them.

Roughly speaking, the dual abelian variety of $A$ parametrises (certain kinds of) [[foag_locally_free_sheaf_on_a_scheme#invertible sheaf 2|line bundles]] on $A$. More precisely, we define $\operatorname{Pic}^{0}(A)$ as the set of line bundles $\mathcal{L}$ on $A$ which satisfy $\tau_{a}^{*} \mathcal{L} \cong \mathcal{L}$ for all $a \in A(\bar{K})$, where $\tau_{a}$[^2] denotes translation by $a $. We may then define the dual [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 6.1|abelian variety as follows]]:
