REMARK 5.4. The [[degree_of_an_algebraic_field_extension|degree]] of an [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.3|isogeny]] $\varphi$ agrees with the order of $\ker \varphi$, where order means rank as a [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.1|group scheme]]. 

When the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.3|isogeny]] is separable (which is always the case in characteristic zero), the order of ker $\phi$ is really the number of geometric points of ker $\phi$

It is useful to know that isogenies can be characterised in many equivalent ways: the following standard result can be found for example in [Mil12], Proposition 8.1].
