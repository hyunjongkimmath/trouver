# Topic[^1]
COROLLARY 3.3 implies that $[n]^{*} \mathcal{L} \cong \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n^{2}}-$[^2]              notice that this is in particular compatible with the assumption $[-1]^{*} \mathcal{L} \cong \mathcal{L}$. It follows that $\left.\left.[n]^{*} \mathcal{L}\right|_{\operatorname{ker}[n]} \cong \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n^{2}}\right|_{\operatorname{ker}[n]}$[^2]              is both trivial and very ample, which is only possible if ker $[n]$[^2]              is zero-dimensional (hence $[n]$[^2]              is an isogeny). Furthermore, writing $\mathcal{L}$ as $\mathcal{O}(D)$, we have
$$
\operatorname{deg}[n](D, \ldots, D)=\left([n]^{*} D, \cdots,[n]^{*} D\right)=\left(n^{2} D, \cdots, n^{2} D\right)=n^{2 g}(D, \ldots, D)
$$
[^2]
where $(D, \ldots, D)$ denotes the intersection product (of divisors). In order to conclude it suffices to show that $(D, \ldots, D)$ is nonzero, but this is easy, because since $\mathcal{L}$ is very ample (hence it induces an embedding $A \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^{N}$ ) we may compute this intersection product as the intersection product of $g$ general hyperplane sections of $A \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^{N}$, and this is clearly positive.
