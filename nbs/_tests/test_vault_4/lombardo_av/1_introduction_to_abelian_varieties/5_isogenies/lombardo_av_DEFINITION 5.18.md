# Abelian subvariety[^1]
Let $A / K$ be an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]]. 

An **abelian subvariety** is a connected subgroup scheme $B \subseteq A$, that is, a subvariety of $A$ that is itself an abelian variety with the induced operations. 

# Simple abelian variety
An abelian variety $A / K$ is said to be **simple** (or $K$-simple, if we want to stress the field of definition) if the only abelian subvarieties of $A$ are $A$ itself and $\left\{0_{A}\right\}$. 

# Geometrically simple abelian variety

When $A \times_{K} \bar{K}$ is simple, one says that $A$ is **geometrically simple** or **absolutely simple**: clearly absolutely simple implies simple, but the converse implication does not hold (for an example see section 1.2 in chapter 3 ).
