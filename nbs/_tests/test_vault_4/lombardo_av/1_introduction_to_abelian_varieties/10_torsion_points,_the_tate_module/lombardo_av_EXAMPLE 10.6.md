EXAMPLE 10.6. Theorem 10.3 is very much false in positive characteristic. For example, if $E / \mathbb{F}_{p}$ is an elliptic [[foag_11.1.3|curve]], then $E[p]$ can never have order $p^{2}$ : the group $E[p]$ can either be trivial, in which case we say that $E$ is supersingular, or it can have order $p$, in which case we say that $E$ is [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.11|ordinary]].

The reason of the failure of $E[p]$ to have order $p^{2}$ is to be found in the fact that $[p]$ can be written as Vero Frob, where the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|Frobenius]] morphism Frob is purely inseparable of [[degree_of_an_algebraic_field_extension|degree]] $p$ (more generally, for a $g$-dimensional [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] one has $[p]=$ Ver o Frob with Frob purely inseparable of [[degree_of_an_algebraic_field_extension|degree]] $p^{g}$ ).

Here Ver is the Verschiebung operator, defined as follows: let $G$ be a [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] commutative [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.1|group scheme]] over a field of characteristic $p$. Then we have a Cartier [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.7|dual]] $G^{*}$, with an associated [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.4|Frobenius]] morphism $\operatorname{Frob} G^{*} G^{*} \rightarrow\left(G^{*}\right)^{(p)}=\left(G^{p}\right)^{*}$. Verschiebung is the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.7|dual]] of $\operatorname{Frob}_{G^{*}}$, so it is a [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 1.1|group scheme]] [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 5.1|homomorphism]] from $G^{p}$ to $G .$
