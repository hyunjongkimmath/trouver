If $S$ is [[foag_noetherian_topological_space|noetherian]] (which is the case in most arithmetic applications!) then [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] presentation can be replaced by [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.10|type]], a property that holds for any reasonable morphism. Recall that $\pi: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow S$ is of [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.10|type]] if the following holds: there is a cover of $S$ by open affine subschemes $S_{i}=\operatorname{Spec}\left(R_{i}\right)$ and a cover of every $\pi^{-1}\left(S_{i}\right)$ by open affine subschemes $\mathcal{A}_{i j}=\operatorname{Spec}\left(B_{i j}\right)$, such that $B_{i j}$ is a finitely generated $R_{i}$-algebra for every $i, j$.

This somewhat abstract definition essentially amounts to asking for a family of [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] $A_{s}$ that varies algebraically with respect to the (geometric) point $s \in S .$ The usefulness of the definition lies in its ability to give a geometric framework for the notion of reduction modulo $p$, which can be defined in concrete terms (e.g. using equations) for elliptic curves, but is much harder to describe in such elementary terms for higher-dimensional [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]]. It is of course also very useful to study the more geometrical problem of understanding families of [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] depending algebraically on some parameters (a typical example being the [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] [[foag_scheme_over_a_ring#Scheme over a ring 1|scheme]] of a family of curves).
