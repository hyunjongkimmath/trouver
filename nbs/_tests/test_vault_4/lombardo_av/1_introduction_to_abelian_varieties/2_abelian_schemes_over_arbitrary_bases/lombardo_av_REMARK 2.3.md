# Topic[^1]
REMARK 2.3. Let $A$ be an [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] over a [[number_field|number field]] $K .$ It is not true in general that $A$ extends to an [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 2.1|abelian scheme]] over $\mathcal{O}_{K}$[^2]               (in fact, this almost never happens): in particular, it is a famous theorem due to Fontaine [Fon85] and Abrashkin that there are no abelian schemes over $\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}) .$ On the other hand, there are some [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] that extend to the full [[18785_Definition 1.25|ring of integers]] of a [[number_field|number field]]: one of the most famous and (to my knowledge) earliest examples is the elliptic [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $E$ over $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{29})$ with equation
$$
y^{2}+x y+a^{2} y=x^{3}
$$
where $a=\frac{5+\sqrt{29}}{2} \in \mathcal{O}_{K}^{\times} .$[^2]              This elliptic [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] extends to an [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 2.1|abelian scheme]] over all of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$[^2]              , or equivalently, in more classical language, it has [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.1|good]] reduction at all the primes of $\mathcal{O}_{K} .$[^2]              
3. Two technical tools: the theorems of the square and of the cube
We collect in this section some technical results that will be useful in what follows. The reader is not expected to spend much time meditating on these theorems, which are only included for completeness (proofs of all these statements can be found in $[\mathrm{Mum} 70]$ ). For the notation $[n]$[^3]               see definition 5.11.4. ABELIAN VARIETIES OVER $\mathbb{C}$
