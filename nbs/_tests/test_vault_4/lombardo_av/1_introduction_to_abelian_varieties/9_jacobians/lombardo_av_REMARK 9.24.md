REMARK 9.24. Notice that in general the dimension of the [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] in question will be much larger than that of $A$.

SKETCH OF PROOF. We may assume $\operatorname{dim} A>1 .$ By embedding $A$ in some [[foag_projective_scheme_over_a_ring#Projective scheme over a ring 1|projective]] space $\mathbb{P}^{N}$ and applying Bertini's theorem 19 sufficiently many times, we find a [[foag_smoothness_over_a_field|smooth]] [[foag_irreducible_topological_space|irreducible]] [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $C$ given by the intersection of $A$ with a linear subspace of $\mathbb{P}^{N}$. This
9 it is a theorem of Torelli that one can recover a [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] from its polarised [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] 10 this argument, as stated, requires the ground field to be infinite; the result, however, is true over any field induces a map $J(C) \rightarrow A$, which we want to show to be surjective. If it is not, then let $A_{1}$ be the image of $J(C)$ in $A$ and let $A_{2}$ be a complement. By pulling back $C$ along the map
$$
\pi: A_{1} \times A_{2} \stackrel{1 \times n}{\longrightarrow} A_{1} \times A_{2} \stackrel{+}{\rightarrow} A
$$
we obtain a [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $\pi^{*}(C)$ which is not [[connected_topological_space|connected]] (because its projection to $C_{2}$ is a [[foag_finite_morphism_of_schemes|finite]] number of points, and not a single point provided that $n>1$ ). This can be shown to be a contradiction.
