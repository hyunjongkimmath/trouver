9. Jacobians
After the previous general introduction we now turn to more concrete objects; accordingly, we also try to make the exposition more detailed and down-to-earth. We start by considering Jacobians, which are ([[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 6.6|principally polarised]]) [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian varieties]] canonically associated with curves. By a [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] defined over $K$ we shall usually mean a [[foag_smoothness_over_a_field|smooth]], [[foag_projective_scheme_over_a_ring#Projective scheme over a ring 1|projective]], [[foag_geometric_point#Geometric properties|geometrically]] [[foag_integral_scheme#Integral scheme 1|integral]] $K$-algebraic variety of dimension $1 ;$ thus, for example, the reader should be warned that "the [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $y^{2}=f(x)$, defined over $\mathbb{Q}^{\prime \prime}$ will really mean "the unique [[foag_smoothness_over_a_field|smooth]] [[foag_projective_scheme_over_a_ring#Projective scheme over a ring 1|projective]] [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] over $\mathbb{Q}$ birational to the affine [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $\left\{y^{2}=f(x)\right\} \subseteq \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}}^{2}$.

9.1. Divisors and their classes. Assume that $K$ is a [[18785_Definition 4.18|perfect field]] and let $C$ be a [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] over $K .$
