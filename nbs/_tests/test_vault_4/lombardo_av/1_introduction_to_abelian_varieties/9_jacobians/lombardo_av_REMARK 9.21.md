# Topic[^1]
REMARK 9.21. I find it very useful to think of the [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] of a [[foag_11.1.3|curve]] $C$ as the [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] whose regular differentials are the same as those of $C$. More precisely, let $i: C \hookrightarrow J$ be the embedding induced by the fixed rational point on $C$. Then there is a canonical pullback map
$$
i^{*}: H^{0}\left(J, \Omega_{J}^{1}\right) \rightarrow H^{0}\left(C, \Omega_{C}^{1}\right)
$$
and the defining property of the [[lombardo_av_THEOREM 9.16|Jacobian]] is essentially that this map is an isomorphism.
