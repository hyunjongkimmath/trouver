# Not every complex torus is an abelian variety[^1]
REMARK 4.3. It is not true that every [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.2|complex torus]] is an abelian variety. The precise conditions under which this happens are known as Riemann relations (see remark 4.9 for a characterisation of abelian varieties among complex tori); the problem is that a general complex torus does not admit an analytic embedding in projective space.
