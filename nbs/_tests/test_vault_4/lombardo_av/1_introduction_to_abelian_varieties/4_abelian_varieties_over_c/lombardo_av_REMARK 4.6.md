REMARK 4.6. Implicit in this proof is the fact that any complex [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]] is isomorphic to $\left(\mathbb{S}^{1}\right)^{g}$ as a topological space, and in fact also as a real analytic variety. All the richness of the theory comes from the complex structure!
${ }^{1}$ notice that this statement is not true if we want to also preserve the complex structure! This is the reason why we replaced $\mathbb{C}^{g}$ with $\mathbb{R}^{2 g}$

We now come to the existence of an embedding in [[foag_projective_scheme_over_a_ring#Projective scheme over a ring 1|projective]] space. In the interest of concreteness, we describe only one of the many possible definitions of a polarisationl' and of the [[lombardo_av_DEFINITION 4.7|dual]] [[lombardo_av_1.3|abelian variety]]:
