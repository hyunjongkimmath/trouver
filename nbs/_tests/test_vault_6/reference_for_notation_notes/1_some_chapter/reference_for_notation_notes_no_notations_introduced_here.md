Given a finite Galois field extension $L/K$, there is a one-to-one correspondence betwteen the subgroups of $\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$ and the subextensions in $L$ over $K$. Under this correspondence, the normal subgroups of $\oepratorname{Gal}(L/K)$ correspond to the subextensions which are Galois over $K$.
