# The polynomial ring of a UFD is a UFD[^1]
Let $q$ be the power of a prime number. Up to isomorphism, there is a unique field with $q$ elements. This field is denoted **$\mathbb{F}_q$** and is called the **finite field of $q$ elements**.

Proof. Say that $q = p^k$ and let $F$ be a field with $q$ elements. First note that $F$ has a subfield "generated by $1$", i.e. the elements $0,1,\ldots,p-1$ form a subfield of $F$.
