# Polynomial ring over a ring[^1]

Let $R$ be a ring. The polynomial ring (in one variable) over $R$ is the ring $R[x]$ whose elements are of the form $\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$ for some $n \geq 0$ and $a_i \in R$ and whose ring structure is given as follows:

$$\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=0}^n
\end{align*}$$
