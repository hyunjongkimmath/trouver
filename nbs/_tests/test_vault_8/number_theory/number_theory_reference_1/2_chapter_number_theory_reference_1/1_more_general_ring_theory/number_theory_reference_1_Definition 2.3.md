# Quotient ring of a ring by an ideal[^1]

Let $R$ be a ring and let $I$ be an ideal. The quotient ring **$R/I$** is the ring whose elements are the equivalence classes of elements of $R$ with respect to the equivalence relation **$\sim$** given by $x \sim y$ if $x-y \in I$ and whose ring structure is given by

$$\begin{align*}
[x]+[y] &= [x+y] \\
[x] \cdot [y] &= [x \cdot y].
\end{align*}$$
