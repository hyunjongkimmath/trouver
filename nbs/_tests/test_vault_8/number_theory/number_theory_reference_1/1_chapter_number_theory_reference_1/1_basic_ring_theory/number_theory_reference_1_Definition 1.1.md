# Ring[^1]

A **(commutative) ring** is a set $R$, equipped with two binary operators, denoted $+$ and $\cdot$, such that the following hold:

1. $R$ is an abelian group under $+$ with identity element $0$.
2. $R$ is an commutative monoid under $\cdot$ with identity element $1$.
3. For all $a,b,c \in R$, we have $a \cdot (b+c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$.
