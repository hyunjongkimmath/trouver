# The ring structure of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is well defined[^1
Proposition 1.8. The addition and multiplication st ructures of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ are well defined.

Proof. 
Let $m_i$ and $m_i'$ be two integers such that $[m_i] = [m_i']$ for $i = 1,2$. Equivalently, $m_i - m_i'$ is divisible by $n$ for each $i$. In particular, $(m_1 + m_2) - (m_1' + m_2')$ equals $(m_1-m_1') + (m_2 - m_2')$, which is divisible by $n$, so $[m_1+m_2] = [m_1' + m_2']$. Therefore, the addition structure is well defined.

Similarly, the multiplication structure is well defined.
