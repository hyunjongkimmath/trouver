    "#### Ver 0.0.5\n",
    "- Modified the `latex_to_path_accepted_string` function to remove some more LaTeX commands and to substitute a few symbols with designated strings.\n",
    "    - The function may be subject to more changes in the near future.\n",
    "- `single_input_for_notation_summarization` now takes a parameter `latex_in_original_comes_first` with a default value of `True`. This default value for the parameter makes it so that inputs/data points for the notation summarization task first lists the `latex_in_original` field containing the notation to be summarized before the mathematical excerpt; previously, the mathematical excerpt was first listed before the `latex_in_original` field.\n",
    "    - The [`notation_summarizations_model`](https://huggingface.co/hyunjongkimmath/notation_summarizations_model) repo now contains a model trained on data points that first list the `latex_in_original` field. Set the `latex_in_original_comes_first` parameter of the `single_input_for_notation_summarization` function to `False` to use the older model.\n",
    "    - Functions using `single_input_for_notation_summarization` now also take a parameter `latex_in_original_comes_first`.\n",
    "- Modified `dict_to_metadata_lines` and `MarkdownFile.replace_metadata` in `04_markdown.markdown.file.ipynb` to take the `enquote_entries_in_fields` parameter that specifies whether or not to enquote string values in fields in YAML metadata of an Obsidian Markdown note.\n",
    "    - Other functions and methods that depend on `MarkdownFile.replace_metadata` were also modified to have `enquote_entries_in_metadata_fields` parameters. These include `MarkdownFile.add_tags`, `MarkdownFile.remove_tags`, `MarkdownFile.replace_auto_tags_with_regular_tags`, and `_write_summary_to_notation_note` in `25_markdown.obsidian.personal.machine_learning.notation_summarization.ipynb`.\n",
    "    - The issue involving `append_summary_to_notation_note` where the modified notation note has non-enquoted text in the `latex_in_original` field should have been at least partially resolved.\n",
    "- Added `parse_metadata_string` to `04_markdown.markdown.file.ipynb` and made `MarkdownFile.metadata` use it.\n",
    "- Added `MarkdownFile.metadata_parts` to `04_markdown.markdown.file.ipynb`.\n",
    "- Added `27_markdown.obsidian.personal.vault.ipynb`. \n",
    "    - Added `setup_obsidian_vault_for_trouver` which is intended to add directories required by `trouver` in an `Obsidian.md` vault\n",
    "- Fixed a bug in the subfunction `_index_note_in_parent_directory` of `index_note_of_note` in `21_markdown.obsidian.personal.information_notes.ipynb`; this bug was preventing the function from properly finding the index note of an information note when the two notes are in the same directory."

    "#### Ver. 0.0.4\n",
    "- Created `tutorial.walkthrough` as a end-to-end walkthrough on setting up a `trouver` workflow.\n",
    "- Added `toml` as a requirement in `settings.ini`.\n",
    "- Moved `pathvalidate` from a Dev requirement to a requirement in `settings.ini`.\n",
    "- Made `release_notes` and moved the version release notes from `index` to `release_notes`.\n",
    "- Made `how_to.install_trouver` and Updated installation instructions.\n",
    "- Updated the docstring of the `MarkdownFile.has_tag` method to more clearly state when it returns `True`.\n",
    "- Modified the `append_summary_to_notation_note` function in `markdown.obsidian.personal.machine_learning.notation_summarization` to take a parameter `overwrite_previous_autogenerated_summary` which, when set to `True`,\n",
    "tells the function to overwrite autogenerated summaries in the notation note (a notation note is considered to have an autogenerated summary if it has the `_auto/notation_summary` tag in its YAML frontmatter metadata).\n",
    "- Modified the `MarkdownFile.remove_tags` method in `markdown.markdown.file` to simply return and not change the `MarkdownFile` object if the `MarkdownFile` object does not have YAML frontmatter metadata or if the frontmatter YAML metadata does not include a `tags` line. In particular, `MarkdownFile.remove_tags` does not raise an Error in either of these cases.\n",
    "- Made the constructor of the `VaultNote` class in `markdown.obsidian.vault` raise a `ValueError` as opposed to an `AssertionError` if both the `name` and `rel_path` parameters are given the argument `None`.\n",
    "- Added some examples for `markdown.obsidian.personal.machine_learning.notation_summarization`\n",
    "- Changed `append_to_notation_note_summarization_database` to use the `'Notation note name'` column as the pivot in invoking the `append_to_database` function; previously, the `'Processed main note contents'` column was used as the pivot column, which meant that data for notation notes sharing the same main note would be lost in making the database csv file.\n",
    "- Made `markdown.obsidian.personal.machine_learning.notation_summarization` import the `os.Path` class; the `notation_summarization` module was previously using the `os.Path` class but not importing it.\n",
    "- Modified `copy_obisidian_vault_configs` and `copy_obsidian_vault_configs_with_nice_modifications` in `markdown.obsidian.personal.reference.ipynb` to take the parameter `dirs_exist_ok`; if this is set to `False`, then attempting to copy configs into an existing configs directory is prevented. Otherwise, existing files in the pre-existing configs directory are overwritten. See also the `dirs_exist_ok` parameter of the [`shutil.copytree`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copytree) function.\n",
    "- Modified `latex_to_path_accepted_string` in `helper` to use the `sanitize_filename` function from the `pathvalidate` library. In particular, this should ensure that `make_notation_notes_from_double_asts` only attempts to create notation notes with names which are valid as file names. \n",
    "- The `custom_commands` function in `latex.convert` can parse LaTeX `\\newcommand` and `\\command` invocations in which the defined command is not surrounded by parentheses, e.g. `\\newcommand\\A{{\\mathbb A}}` is recognized as defining the command `\\A` which has display text `{\\mathbb A}`.\n",
    "- Made `adjust_common_syntax_to_markdown` in `latex.convert` recognize the `eqnarray` environment as an environment to adjust."

    "- Finished implementing `append_summary_to_notation_note`\n",

    "- Fixed a bug in `_obsidian_vault_plugin_configs_file`; I had realized that files for non-core `Obsidian.md` plugins are stored in `.obsidian/plugins/<plugin_name>` in the vault directory.\n",
    "- Changed the default `template_location` argument from `'.'` to `'/'` in `markdown.obsidian.personal.reference`.\n",
