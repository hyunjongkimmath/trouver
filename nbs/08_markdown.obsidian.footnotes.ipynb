    "we let $\\overline{Z}$ be the scheme theoretic closure of $(Z \\times_Y \\operatorname{Bl}_X Y) \\setminus (W \\times_Y \\operatorname{Bl}_X Y)$ in $Z \\times_Y \\operatorname{Bl}_X Y$, and we define $E_{\\overline{Z}}$ as the pullback of $E_X Y$ to $\\overline{Z}$.\n",
    "\n",

    "(1) First, note that if $Z \\rightarrow Y$ is a closed embedding, then the Blow-Up Closure Lemma states that the [[foag_ 22.2.5|proper transform]] (as defined in $\\S 22.2$ ) is the blow-up of $Z$ along the scheme-theoretic intersection $W=X \\cap Z$[^2]\n",
    "\n",
    "[^2]: The proper transform is $\\overline{Z}$. The Blow-Up closure lemma says that $\\operatorname{Bl}_W Z$ is $\\overline{Z}$, where $W$ [[foag_ 22.2.5|is the fibered product]] $X \\times_Y Z$, which [[foag_ 9.2.C|is]] $X \\cap Z$. \n",

    "## The blow-up can be computed by taking the scheme-theoretic closure of the complement of the blowing-up locus in the blow-up\n",
    "(2) In particular, the Blow-Up Closure Lemma lets you actually compute blowups, and we will do lots of examples soon. For example, suppose $C$ is a plane curve, singular at a point $p$, and we want to blow up $C$ at $p$. Then we could instead blow up the plane at $p$ (which we have already described how to do, even if we haven't yet proved that it satisfies the universal property of blowing up), and then take the scheme-theoretic closure of $\\mathrm{C} \\backslash\\{\\mathrm{p}\\}$ in the blow-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Blow-ups of a finite type $k$-scheme can be computed locally via blow-ups of coordinate linear spaces\n",
    "(3) More generally, if $W$ is some nasty subscheme of $Z$ that we wanted to blowup, and $Z$ were a finite type k-scheme, then the same trick would work. We could work locally ([Exercise $22.2.\\mathrm{A}$](foag_%2022.2.A)), so we may assume that $Z$ is affine. If $W$ is cut out by $r$ equations $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r} \\in \\Gamma\\left(Z, O_{Z}\\right)$, then complete the $f^{\\prime}$ s to a generating set $\\mathrm{f}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{f}_{n}$ of $\\Gamma\\left(\\mathrm{Z}, \\mathscr{O}_{\\mathrm{Z}}\\right) .$ This gives a closed embedding $\\mathrm{Y} \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{A}^{\\mathrm{n}}$ such that $\\mathrm{W}$ is the scheme-theoretic intersection of $Y$ with a coordinate linear space $A^{n-r}$.\n",
