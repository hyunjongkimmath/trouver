In the above line of code, we pass `vault` as an argument, signifying that the `VaultNote` object should represent a note from the specified Obsidian vault (as opposed to a file in any directory outside of `vault`). We also pass the Python string `f'_index_{reference}'` as the argument to the `name` parameter --- in this case the string equals the string `'_index_kim_park_ga1dcmmc'` --- signifying that the `VaultNote` object should represent the note named `_index_kim_park_ga1dcmmc` (recall that `trouver` operates under the assumption that no two notes in an Obsidian vault have the same name). \n",
