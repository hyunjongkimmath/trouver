    "title": "Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases",
    "summary": "Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of\nallowed moves of arbitrary length. We show that the diameter of these graphs on\nfibers of a fixed integer matrix can be bounded from above by a constant. We\nthen study the mixing behaviour of heat-bath random walks on these graphs. We\nalso state explicit conditions on the set of moves so that the heat-bath random\nwalk, a generalization of the Glauber dynamics, is an expander in fixed\ndimension.",
