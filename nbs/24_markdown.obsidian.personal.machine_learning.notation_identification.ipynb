    "\n",
    "In `markdown.obsidian.personal.notation`, we explained why it is convenient to keep notation notes. To automatically make such notation notes, one needs a way to identify notations; more precisely, one needs a way to identify where notations are newly introduced \n",
    "\n",
    "The author of `trouver` surrounds (newly introduced) definitions and notations with double asterisks `**` in his `Obsidian.md` math vault; note that surrounding text with double asterisks `**` can boldface said text[^1]. This particular notebook focuses on notations, rather than definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: However, LaTeX math mode text does not get bold-faced with double asterisks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of `trouver`, a notation is (contained in) a purely LaTeX math mode text[^2] that is surrounded by double asterisks `**`, whereas a definition is any other double asterisk surrounded text. \n",
    "\n",
    "[^2]: For the purposes of `trouver`, a math mode text must be an in-line math mode text surrounded by single dollar signs `$` or display math mode text surrounded by double dollar signs `$$`. This is because Markdown does not recognize `\\( \\)` and `\\[ \\]` for math mode text.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The **Galois group** of a Galois extension $L/K$ is the group **$\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$** whose elements are the automorphisms of the field $L$ fixing $K$ pointwise. For example, $\\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{R})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2 \\mathbb{Z}$ with complex conjugation as the nontrivial element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the text `Galois group` constitutes a definition and `$\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$` constitutes a notation. On the other hand, the LaTeX math mode strings `$\\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{R})$` and `$\\mathbb{Z}/2 \\mathbb{Z}$` do not newly introduce notations (or definitions for that matter) in the context of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, in\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "A **Hausdorff space** or a **$T_2$-space** is a topological space $X$ such that for all $x,y \\in X$, there exist open neighborhoods $U$ and $V$ of $x$ and $y$ such that $U \\cap V = \\emptyset$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the texts `Hausdorff space` and `$T_2$-space` are both definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following has an example of a notation that can also be regarded as a definition. For the purposes of `trouver`, this is considered a notation. In some sense, most to all notations can be regarded as definitions as well as notations and hence we classify such things as notations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "Given an ideal $I$ of a ring $R$, **$R/IR$** is the ring whose underlying set is the set $R$ modulo the equivalence relation $\\sim$ where $a \\sim b$ if and only if $a-b \\in I$ and whose addition and multiplication structures are defined by...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One downside to this convention is that a notation for the purposes of `trouver` might contain extraneous information. For example, in \n",
