Mathematicians constantly need to learn and read about concepts with
which they are unfamiliar. Keeping mathematical notes in an
[`Obsidian.md`](https://obsidian.md/) vault can help with this learning
process as `Obsidian.md`

This file will become your README and also the index of your
documentation.

TODO: add how the `nbs` folder has a `_tests` folder.

## Miscellaneous

This repository is still in its preliminary stages and much of the code
and documentation may be faulty or not well formatted. The author
greatly appreciates reports of these issues or suggestions on edits;
please feel free to report them on the `Issues` section of this
repository. The [author](https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/hyunjongkim)
of this repository, who is primarily a mathematician (a PhD student at
the time of this writing), does not guarantee quick responses or
resolutions to such issues, but will do his best to address them.

## For developers

This repository is based on the [`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/)
template. As such, code for the packages as well as the documentation
for the repository are written in jupyter notebooks (the `.ipynb` files
in the `nbs` folder) and the Python modules are auto-generated via the
command-line command
[`nbdev_export`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/doclinks.html#nbdev_export)
(or
[`nbdev_prepare`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html#prepare-your-changes),
which among other things runs `nbdev_export`.).

### Troubleshooting

- In the `nbs/_tests` folder, make sure that the folders that you want
  to test are not empty; since git does not track empty folders, empty
  folders will not be pushed in GitHub and the tests in GitHub Actions
  may yield different results than in a local computer.
