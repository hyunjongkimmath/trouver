## How the examples are structured

TODO: add how the `nbs` folder has a `_tests` folder.

## For developers
### Troubleshooting
- In the `nbs/_tests` folder, make sure that the folders that you want to test are not empty; since git does not track empty folders, empty folders will not be pushed in GitHub and the tests in GitHub Actions may yield different results than in a local computer.
